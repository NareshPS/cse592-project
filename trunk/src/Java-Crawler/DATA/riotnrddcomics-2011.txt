Transcript: Sam and Palmer sit in silence. SAM: So you are… PALMER: An elf. SAM: And that is…? PALMER: A boffer staff. SAM: I’m not judging you, babe, but I don’t know if I get it. I see how role-playing is fun, but you role-play in your band. And for that you don’t have to get blue… PALMER: Well… when I’m with the band, everyone sees Harry Potter. You know? They have this fully formed idea of who I am. When I’m LARPing, other players don’t have all these pre-conceived notions about me or my gender. They’re just trying to figure out if I’m a drae or a sea elf. PALMER: And… I mean… if they DO interrogate me about my gender, I have the option of hitting them with a boffer staff.

Transcript: Wren and Sam talk in the hallway outside anime club. WREN: Alright, what’s the deal here? SAM: I’m allowed to have interests! I just joined a club, so what? WREN: Interests that you totally hide from your friends? A club in which the discovery of your presence causes you to turn bright pink? SAM: Fine! I was embarrassed, ok? Mystery solved. WREN: I don’t get it. This doesn’t seem like your thing at all. SAM: It’s not, really – I just – sigh. SAM: When I was young, I didn’t know anything about lesbians or queer people. I knew I was gay, but I thought I was such a freak. Manga was the first place I saw girls who loved other girls, and it just seemed so, normal. I went to an anime club meeting because… I guess because I never talked about it with anyone. SAM: And I came back for this meeting because they were going to watch Princess Mononoke tonight. WREN: Ooo, I might stay for that, actually.

Transcript: Wren sits down on the floor, looking angry. An empty bottle and a crushed red solo cup sit beside her. In panel two, she looks sad. It is slightly darker. In panel three, her eyes are closed and she’s relaxed, as if sleeping. It is slightly darker than before. She makes a soft snoring noise, “snnn”. In panel four, she’s still sleeping, but a party-goer holding a beer in one hand is placing a lampshade on her head with the other hand. The party-goer looks thoroughly amused, and laughs a small “heh heh”.

Sorry if it’s uncomfortable. WREN: Well, thanks. I really appreciate that. But I grew up in Hawaii, and my family was Mormon, so I don’t really think of pocky and Love Hina as “my culture”. ASHLEY: YOU were a Mormon?? That’s so funny! WREN: It really, really wasn’t. ASHLEY: But it’s like – a contradiction! WREN: Um. I’m pretty sure I am a real thing.

Transcript: Wren, Maria and Sam sit in mismatched chairs around a table in Maria’s apartment. Sam holds a notebook. SAM: It looks like these outlines are enough material for the next three issues. MARIA: Wow! That was too easy. WREN: Meeting at your place is so much better than the library – we can talk as loud as we want, and Sam’s not always getting distracted by books. There’s a KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK at the door. Maria stands up. MARIA: Huh, who could that be? SAM: Hey, I was not the only one taking browsing breaks, Wren. WREN: Yeah, yeah. Maria returns, holding a white box with three holes in it. MARIA: Weird. WREN: What? MARIA: It was my landlord. Someone dropped off a box for me. WREN: Sketchy. What’s the return address?

We made your new pal here a convert? HARRY SQUATTER/PALMER: Yep. HERMIONE STRANGER/BAILER: Well! Maybe we should actually play more often. SAM: Do you not do a lot of gigs? HARRY SQUATTER/PALMER: Nah, we mostly just post our stuff to the internet, but we haven’t written anything new in a while. SAM: That’s too bad. I’d love to see you again. HARRY SQUATTER/PALMER: Well, you know, I don’t have to be playing a show. We could just… see each other again.

Transcript: Maria walks through a crowd. People say things like, “excuse me, sir.” “What’s up, man?” and “Yo, dude!” MARIA: Uh, Sam? I’m feeling kind of uncomfortable here. Do you wanna maybe come hang at my apartment for a while? SAM: Oh, well… I sort of just met someone, and we were hitting it off really well, so I said I’d be around here for a while… MARIA: Oh. Ok. SAM: Sorry. Wren’s going with you though, right? She’ll probably love an excuse to get out of here. MARIA: I can’t find her anywhere. I guess she probably went home. She was pretty miserable. Outside, Nhi gently kisses a surprised Wren.

Transcript: Wren and Maria have left the party and now sit on a bench in a residential neighborhood. MARIA: As soon as they started up the beer pong, it was all, “no homo” and “faggot” and, just, totally awful. I’m sorry we missed Nhi’s party. WREN: It’s ok. I’m sorry that I was trying to boss you around. MARIA: Thanks for waiting for me. WREN: Of course.

Transcript: WREN: Ok. This won’t be so bad. It’ll be like I’m someone else listening to myself talk about comics and TV, but I won’t know what I’m talking about. WREN: Ugh, that sounds terrible. Maybe I should just hand in my outline late when I think of a better topic. WREN: No! I’m an anthropologist. This is fieldwork. Getting nervous and backing out of my first assignment just because I might not like what some of my subjects are talking about is not a good start. Wren walks into a room where several seated anime club members stare at her, and one standing addresses her. WREN: Hi, I’m Wren Watanabe, and I was wondering – KID: Konnichiwa, Watanabe-san! WREN: Uh. Yeah. Hi. KID: Welcome to Massachusetts College University! WREN: I GO HERE, THANKS.

WREN: It was a nightmare. And not even an interesting nightmare. NHI: Sorry. I thought they’d be a good subject since they’re so aggressive about recruiting and secretive about what they do at meetings. You know, like a cult. WREN: Where the heck am I going to find a local subculture to study by tonight? NHI: Oh! Oh! Idea! Wren sits in Nhi’s D&D group. SUSIE: Nhi! Quit playing Lois Lane roving reporter with your girlfriend for a second and roll for freaking damage! NHI: How about I roll for YOUR FACE.

SAM: Wren, what a horrible thing to say! WREN: You’re right, I’m sorry. Listen, what’s say we go back to the dorm and watch some LOST season one like I’ve been wanting to? SAM: Please, Wren. If I wanted to waste my time trying to untangle pseudo-philosophical nonsense I’d read James Joyce, at least I wouldn’t feel my brain rotting as I - SAM: Oh.

SAM: And the fighting had nothing to do with you. I think Wren and Maria haven’t been communicating well since we all got here. But they’ve been best friends since they were nine, I’m sure now that they have some time alone, it’ll be a lot less tense and they’ll work it out. WREN: WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE SUCH A BUTT?

Transcript: SAM: Mmm, you smell so good after a nice shower. And I love your wet hair. PALMER: Eh, I think it looks so weird and long when it’s wet.

Transcript: Since I spent all my time on my computer yesterday wrestling with a virus, today in lieu of a comic, I'm posting some of the earliest sketches of Riot Nrrd. They were done in a free program called GIMP, and they're a little horrendous. Appropriately, I pulled them together on my partner's computer, and I type this through paint. This is probably the first thing I ever drew on my tablet. Sam was originally a redhead. I also planned on her wearing these chunky beads all the time. Somewhere in the margins of my college notebooks, I have the very first sketch of Maria, which looks nothing like this. She had long, straight hair and was much more stylish and feminine. But I felt like it leaned too much on images of trans women we already see. I thought, her best friend Wren is a tomboy, why shouldn't Maria get to be butch sometimes too? I started thinking of her as "sporty", but now she's pretty much the character I dress like myself. Wren's hair is hard to draw at a lot of angles, but it's probably the only hairstyle in the comic that's guaranteed not to change. It was one of the first things I envisioned about any of the characters - Wren in general has changed the least since the beginning. Maria has probably changed the most - her hair and clothes have gone through a few re-designs, but I also changed her eyes (they're almost bizarrely anime-ish here) and the shape of her head as I went along (to distinguish her silouhette from Wren's).
