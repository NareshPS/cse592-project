When's the last time you cleaned your shower? / King Luca: Oh, I leave THAT to the handmaiden. / Suzy Gee: That better not be a new pet name. / King Luca: I thought the white stuff was "grout." / Suzy Gee: Grout goes BETWEEN the tiles. This is soap scum... Watch. / King Luca: That's SOAP? / Suzy Gee: Yeah, why? / King Luca: Well, if that's soap, what are you using to clean it? / [[Suzy Gee Seethes]] http://nukees.com/d/20010312.html

Suzy Gee: Why's Gav afraid of the server anyway? / King Luca: Oh, you know... that whole Gavicidal virus thing... / Suzy Gee: Oh yeah. How could I forget? / Suzy Gee: Wait. How COULD I forget? Whatever happened to Teri anyway? Wasn't she supposed to have destroyed all known civilization by now? / King Luca: I dunno. Can we login and ask her? / Suzy Gee: You don't think that's rude? / Gav: Speaking of rude...

I can't even thank Jeannie for taking me home that one night... / Suzy Gee: Ah, so that was Jeannie's house you called from? Where was she? / Gav: *Sigh* Yes... two toothbrushes. / Suzy Gee: Um... Hello, what? / Gav: I should've noticed it then -- there were two toothbrushes in her bathroom. The logical conclusion is that she has a boyfriend. She must have spent the night at his place... / Suzy Gee: Since when did you start making -- or believing -- logical conclusions? / Gav: Pull up a chair and a box of tissues. http://nukees.com/d/20010326.html

Suzy Gee: It's been a silly day, so I'm going to ask again on the off chance I'll get a sensible answer: how DID a PENGUIN drive the ant all the way from Antarctica? / Gav: Oh, that's not important, Suzy Gee. I'm sure Danny installed a "RETURN HOME" button or something. You can ask him when you guys get him out of jail. / [[King Luca is seen explaining something to Linus]] / Suzy Gee: Oh yeah, THAT. Rock candy on a STICK! It's hard to concentrate on one thing at a time around here. / Gav: Why LIMIT yourself?

Civil rights mandates? Case law? Extridition? He's not CAPABLE of this. I've seen him get convicted of two felonies on his first day of jury duty. / King Luca: VERILY! I regret to concede, but methinks we need reinforcements. / Suzy Gee: One charge was for TREASON, I think... / King Luca: How I long for the good old days when this could be better solved with a short seven year crusade... / Suzy Gee: I mean geez...

According to these documents, your friend Danny has done NOTHING wrong. / Suzy Gee: Correct me if I'm histrionic, Cecilia, but shouldn't that HELP Danny's case? / Cecilia: Oh, Duchess, you're SUCH a scientist sometimes. / Suzy Gee: What? / Cecilia: See, if Danny was being CHARGED with a crime, we could FIGHT it. But he hasn't DONE anything. You can't argue with them there... / Suzy Gee: WHAT? / Cecilia: Yup, once you've been charged with nothing, you've HAD it. I suggest we start by planting drugs in his apartment. http://nukees.com/d/20010418.html

NO! / Suzy Gee: Don't call me "Duchess Suzy" EITHER... / Cecilia: Yes, Duchess. / Suzy Gee: No Duchess, PERIOD!! / Cecilia: I would NEVER call you THAT, Duchess, despite that temper. / voice from outside the panel: You are the weakest link.

Danny: AH! I am not good at such sneakiness! That is what YOU do! / Gav: That's why YOU have to do it! / Gav: Luca will be suspicious if I start asking questions. You're too afraid of confrontation to try it. / Danny: Yes! I am! I will not! / Gav: Besides, I have to star sixty nine the phone. / Danny: There is no need to be vulgar. / Danny: But there IS a reason "interrogate" contains the word "terror." http://nukees.com/d/20060118.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060120.html
Danny: Hello King Luc-- / King Luca: UNBELIEVABLE!! They simply will NOT give up! I told them "NAY," yet they persist trying to force me to sell my ancestral land! / King Luca: [[grabbing Danny by the front of his shirt for added emphasis]] What is a king without his land?! I'd sooner sell them my crown and spear, if not for the unkindest cut of all-- I hath MISPLACED them!! What SAY you, citizen Danny? / [[Danny is stunned for a moment]] / Danny: [[reading a note prepared earlier]] Hello king Luca... What seems to be the matter...? http://nukees.com/d/20060120.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060123.html
Gav: DANNY! What did you find out? / Danny: King Luca rants loudly of an unwanted land deal... / Gav: Well, He's not delusional. About THIS, I mean. The call return connected me with a land development company. I flirted with the receptionist for information. / Danny: How did that go? / Gav: Mixed results. She gave me this company info... / Danny: How is this "mixed?" / Gav: Well... she was ugly... and bi-polar. / Danny: Ah! AGAIN you had to promise a girl that you will never call back in exchange for information? http://nukees.com/d/20060123.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060125.html
Gav: The company is "Southern Californian Unlimited Markets, Ltd:" venture capitalists based in L.A. The C.E.O is a Mr. Karl Oz. / Gav: Apparently, they're mostly involved in strip malls and gated communities. / Danny: Do you think King Luca is really a land owner? / Gav: If so, my sponging efforts have been vastly underambitious... / Danny: It is too bad basic decency prohibits us from further invasion of his privacy. / Gav: Danny, you CAN'T think... / Danny: I know. I just wish to state it for the record. http://nukees.com/d/20060125.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060127.html
Gav: There's not much on the internet... Erg, we have just enough info to be infuriated! But I can't call back for more... / Danny: Well, what can we do, short of driving down to-- / Gav: What was that, Danny? / Danny: NOTHING! / Gav: You said... / Danny: No I did NOT!! Something else! I suggested... Uh er... That maybe, um I could flirt with the receptionist! / Gav: Why, Danny! / Danny: What did I just say?! http://nukees.com/d/20060127.html
 
http://nukees.com/d/20060130.html
Danny: How did I get talked into this? / Gav: I said, "Get in the car, Danny, we're going to Los Angeles." / Danny: I was tricked. / Gav: It's too bad the giant robot ant is gavicidal right now. I'd rather have driven IT down than Sabrina here. [No offense, Sabrina] / Danny: Why is that? / Gav: When we hit the L.A. freeways, Danny, you'll understand. http://nukees.com/d/20060130.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060201.html
Danny: Why can this not be taken care of over the phone? / Gav: I'm going to teach you some essential life skills, Danny. Skills such as "dumpster diving." / Danny: Sounds wholly unrespectable. / Gav: AND unsanitary! / Gav: Think of this as a little vacation, Danny. When's the last time you took some time off from equation grinding? / Danny: I'll have you know I spend half of each Saturday solving Sudoku puzzles without using calculus, so THERE! http://nukees.com/d/20060201.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060203.html
Gav: Do it! Do it now! / Danny: I am not going to tinkle while you are watching! And where is the urinal? This is just a rock wall! / Gav: Okay, Danny, I'm outside. Pee now! / Danny: STOP PRESSURING ME!! Why did you make me hold it untill we got here? / [[A sign outside the building reads: Welcome! Madonna Inn San Luis Obispo]] / [[sound of peeing in progress]] <> / Danny: Truely, it is one of the wonders of the modern world... / Gav: What did I tell you?! http://nukees.com/d/20060203.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060206.html
Cecilia: What's wrong, nukee bear? / King Luca: Huh? Oh, greetings milady Cecilia. 'Tis nothing worth troubling thy pretty head. / Cecilia: I WANT to know the things that trouble you, king sweetie. That's what snugglebunnies DO! / King Luca: 'Tis not myself for whom I fret. I worry for old friends. Friends that... Perhaps... I should call... I must go retrieve my little velvet address book. / Cecilia: Oh, THAT? Here you go! / [[Cecilia pulls King Luca's little velvet address book from her bosom.]] / Cecilia: What?! It was in a locked box behind the refridgerator, so I figured you wanted it kept SAFE. http://nukees.com/d/20060206.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060208.html
Cecilia: Please don't be mad, sweetie! I didn't read your little book. / King Luca: Nay, lady Cecilia. It seems thou didst not! / King Luca: Previously, I folded a hair across the pages. It remains unmolested. / Cecilia: I wouldn't know about that. But I would never violate your privacy. / King Luca: Indeed, perhaps I can believe thou wouldst not! / Cecilia: What we have means everything to me! I could never jeopardize it! / Cecilia: [[thinking]] ... Not when you use such obvious tactics as the "hair across the book spine" trick... http://nukees.com/d/20060208.html

Danny: This is a cute town... / Gav: This is my hometown. / Danny: Really? I did not realize you were a bronzed beach bunny, Gav! / Gav: Ha ha, no, I wasn't an outdoor kid. Not like YOU leave the lab for less than sustenance and earthquakes. / Danny: I am more tan than you! / Gav: You're Chinese! / Danny: I watched an eclipse last month... / Gav: You watched it online! / [[Both are sitting on the beach watching the sun set]] / Danny: I have sand in my shorts. / Gav: You brought this on yourself. http://nukees.com/d/20060210.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060213.html
Danny: Where are we going now, Gav? / Gav: To my parents' house, of course. I'm not springing for a hotel room! / Danny: You have parents? / Gav: Of course! What, did you think I was congealed in a vat or something? / Danny: I do now. / Gav: Well, I wasn't. I had a perfectly normal american childhood. / Danny: Is that not an oxymoron? / Gav: Normally. I had the only one. http://nukees.com/d/20060213.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060215.html
Gav: Hi mom. I'm home! / Gav's Mom: Is that my athiest son? / Danny: You did not tell your parents we were coming? / Gav: Of course not. Mom, this is my friend, Danny. Danny, mom. / Danny: Everything here is purple! / Gav's Mom: Have a seat, boys. Dinner will be ready in seven minutes. / Danny: There were already two extra place settings. / Gav: Ah, mom! http://nukees.com/d/20060215.html

Suzy Gee: I don't expect compassion, but you don't have to ENJOY my pain. / Gav: No ... It's just weird. King Luca with Cecilia? FUNNY weird. / Gav: I guess it's MY fault, actually. That night she tried to off herself, I dropped her off at King Luca's house. They must've hooked up after that ... / Suzy Gee: Cecilia tried to KILL herself?! / Gav: Well, I found her unconscious in bed next to a bottle of PILLS ... / Suzy Gee: So you broke into her house and abducted her while she was asleep? / Gav: ENTIRELY POSSIBLE! http://nukees.com/d/20051121.html
http://nukees.com/d/20051123.html
Gav: I have to think about that... now where was I? / Suzy Gee: Oh who knows? Death? Betrayal? Blasphemy? Deceit? / Gav: No... what King Luca said about you... / Suzy Gee: Listen! I Just don't care! It's all too much! I'll be happy to leave your secrets behind with you in this piss-soaked town. / Gav: What does that mean? / Suzy Gee: It means I'm done, Gav. I'm graduating this semester. / Gav: Gah?! No! Who will I annoy? / Suzy Gee: Trust me, you'll do just fine... http://nukees.com/d/20051123.html

King Luca: Why, if 'tisn't the inquisitive Miss Cindy Lee Gee! To what doth we oweth the pleasure...? / [shock panel] / King Luca: You stay away from her, do you hear me, Cindy Lee?! I'm only warning you *once*. Stay away from her or I'll *make* you... / King Luca: ... I mean "*maketh thee...*" Er, I mean "Wrong number!" / Cecilia: I choose to believe you for my own benefit! http://nukees.com/d/20051128.html

Suzy Gee: Luca--my ex-boyfriend--said I'm like you?! / Gav: Well, not in those words... / Gav: He was glad that you've "hardened your heart against the world..." / Suzy Gee: So? / Gav: So? "Hardened heart?!" Does that sound like King Luca? The man gives presents to department store Santas! / Suzy Gee: You mean copies of his self-published "An Agnostica Carol..."? / Gav: Well, he's not without an agenda. http://nukees.com/d/20051130.html

Gav: Point being: You're cynical, bitter, mistrusting...you have a hyperinflated sense of self...you delight in the booting of small yipping dogs...you're ME. / Suzy Gee: I do NOT kick puppies! And I'm NOT YOU. / Gav: It's nothing to be ashamed of, Suzy Gee! I have MUCH to teach you! / Suzy Gee: FEH! Like what? / Gav: Lesson One: SELF-love is the only requited love. / Suzy Gee: What about self-LOATH? / Gav: No, that's universal. http://nukees.com/d/20051202.html

[[Outside Flake's]] / Gav: Hey, we're HERE! / Suzy Gee: Eh? / Gav: You've been devestated. Of COURSE we need a drink! / Suzy Gee: My ASS! What, so you can slip me another Goofy? / Gav: You mean a Roofie? / Suzy Gee: Actually, I meant a Mickey... / Gav: All I have is a Donald and a Pluto. / Suzy Gee: So THAT'S why you followed me across campus? SCREW YOU, Gav! I'm going home to study so I can graduate and get AWAY from you A.S.A.P! / Jezebel: [[smoking in Flake's doorway]] If YOU didn't knock her out, I would have. / Gav: Yeah, she makes a KILLER bitch, doesn't she? http://nukees.com/d/20051205.html

Gav: Oh HEY! It's ... uh ... YOU! / Offscreen Voice: Jezebel?! / Gav: Sure ... Jezebel ... / Gav: And YOU two ... / Jezebel: Chris and Julia ... / Gav: Yeah ... Chris and ... / Gav: There was ANOTHER one ... / Christine, Jezebel, and Julia: [[together]] RITA! / Gav: Yeah ... she's ... uh ... not here ... / Gav: You girls have just GOT to teach me how you make me feel like I'm covered in spiders! http://nukees.com/d/20051207.html
http://nukees.com/d/20051209.html
Chris: Jezebel, what are you doing here? / Gav: Isn't that MY line? And wha... aren't you three TOGETHER? / Jezebel: Of course not. These two goats have strayed from the fold... / Gav: Don't you mean sheep? / Jezebel: Mn. Let's get a drink... / [[Jezebel and Gav enter the bar]] / [[Christine and Julia stand in the open door holding their hands up protectively as if blinded]] / Julia: HISS! / Chris: YAA! / Gav: They can no longer enter a house of worship? / Jezebel: Something like that. http://nukees.com/d/20051209.html
http://nukees.com/d/20051212.html
Gav: An anti-bar curse? It's like hell on earth. / Jezebel: It's crap. / Gav: What? / Jezebel: They're just under 21. And hyperdramatic. / Gav: So why are you girls here? / Christine: To learn more about the Danny, of course. / Gav: Then follow HIM! / Christine: Yeah... uh... he may be enlightened, but we can not understand a word he says. http://nukees.com/d/20051212.html
 
http://nukees.com/d/20051214.html
Gav: They're following me to learn how not to live their lives. Is that insulting or flattering? / Jezebel: Can't it be both? / Gav: And you? Why are you following me? / Jezebel: I wasn't following you. I was waiting for you. / Gav: What's the difference? / Gav: No wait, don't tell me. I have two restraining orders on me with the answer to that question. http://nukees.com/d/20051214.html

[[At Flake's]] / Gav: Spooky girl, you're talking to someone who sees the serpent as the HERO of the bible. So I hope you're not still trying to convert me. / [[Jezebel is sipping drink]] / Jezebel: Mm. You're an atheist, right? / Gav: Natch. / Jezebel: And EVIL? / Jeannie: Like Microsoft money! / Gav: CUTE, Jeannie. / Jezebel: Well, aren't good and evil constructs of a superior divinity? / Gav: Only if you feel GUILTY about it. http://nukees.com/d/20051216.html
http://nukees.com/d/20051219.html
Jezebel: The world could very well be MORE evil than good Gav, but only YOU embrace it...even Hitler thought he was doing right. / Jezebel: But Evil without delusion, guilt or justification? It's a lie. I suspect you seek only the reputation of evil... / Gav: Bite your tongue!! I AM evil! / Jezebel: Prove it. / [[Gav shoves Jezebel off the barstool, and she falls to the floor]] / Gav: I'm sorry, that was probably justifiable. Get back up here and let's try again... http://nukees.com/d/20051219.html
http://nukees.com/d/20051221.html
Jezebel: [[getting up from floor]] When I'm angry, I try to think of Scripture, but when I'm with you, the only passages I can think of are from Revelations. / Gav: Oh Yeah that's the best one! / Jezebel: The question, really, is what drove you to embrace evil so cavalierly? / Gav: Cavalierly? / Jezebel: [[uprights her stool]] I mean look at you. It's clearly not for power, money, women... or any other social advantage... / Gav: [[knocks her over again]] Huh... well, then, when and why did you turn evil? / Jezebel: [[from floor]] Three seconds after I met you. http://nukees.com/d/20051221.html
http://nukees.com/d/20051223.html
Jezebel: Look, Gav, I know your kind. You were hurt once...BAD. So bad, that you turned your back on the world so that it could never hurt you again... / Gav: Not true. I get hurt on a daily basis. / Jezebel: But I'm telling you... There's someone out there you can trust implicitly. Someone who will love you no matter what a pathetic wretch you grow up to be... / Gav: Yeah? We'll see when I forget a third mother's day in a row... / Jezebel: Okay, two someones... http://nukees.com/d/20051223.html

Jezebel: I'm talking about JESUS, you freak. He loves you and always will. / Gav: AH! Jesus is GAY! / Gav: Wait, don't you have to follow Jesus' example?! / Jezebel: Of course. / Gav: Then YOU have to love me, too. No matter what? / Jezebel: Uh ... Well ... Yes ... / Gav: Suddenly, I see the exploitable allure of this religion! / Jezebel: I used to love our old, blind, smelly family dog, but we were all happier after we put it down ... http://nukees.com/d/20051226.html
http://nukees.com/d/20051228.html
Gav: Why are you so interested in dragging me over to your side, anyway? / Jezebel: You've got it backwards. I don't need you. You need me. / Jezebel: Chew on that overnight. I'll see you tomorrow. / Gav: Sure... Wait, tomorrow?! / Jezebel: Yeah. I've decided I kinda like this place... Think I'll make it my new regular hangout. / Gav: Jeannie, we're going to need to paint this door in goat's blood again. / Jeannie: Oh no. I refuse to go through another valentine's day! http://nukees.com/d/20051228.html
http://nukees.com/d/20051230.html
[[On the street, Jezebel walking off]] / Gav : Jezebel, wait up... / Gav: Before you go, I just wanna know... How can you believe something just on faith? There are so many religions with no evidence that any are correct. What if you had an intense spiritual experience that seemed to contradict your beliefs? What would you believe then? / Jezebel: Silly boy... The logical choice is the one that makes you happy, of course... / Gav: I should drink beer until that makes more or less sense. http://nukees.com/d/20051230.html

I mean, of course we had servants cook for us. / Cecilia: Of course! Tell me more of the life of little prince Luca! / King Luca: Nay, such regalement is the work of bards. Tell me instead more of thy childhood. / Cecilia: Okay, but the doctor said I shouldn't talk about ages 5, 11, or 14. / King Luca: Or a quiet breakfast... http://nukees.com/d/20060104.html

Cecilia: Daddy was a chemist. That's why I ended up in law school. / King Luca: I love a non-sequitur as much as the next giraffe, but... / Cecilia: He tried to get me interested in science, but I was no good... / Cecilia: I became a psychology major because I thought it was a science without math and would make him proud. But I was wrong. / King Luca: He wasn't proud? / Cecilia: What the hell is a "chi squared" and what does it have to do with electrocuting monkeys? http://nukees.com/d/20060106.html
http://nukees.com/d/20060109.html
Cecilia: Anyway, I didn't know what to do with a psych degree, so I went to law school. It sounded professional! I'm not really sure what daddy thinks of that. / King Luca: What dost thy mother think? / Cecilia: Mom...um, "left" us when I was eleven... / King Luca: Methinks 'twas quite possibly the most ominous "um" to which mine ears shall ever bear witness! / Cecilia: She...um, died... / King Luca: I stand corrected. / Cecilia: No, don't, sillykins!!

King Luca: Greetings, Gav! What art thou doing? / Gav: My VCR is broken. / [[Pieces of Gav's VCR are strewn around on the floor.]] / [[King Luca pokes some VCR parts with his sceptre.]] / King Luca: Mayhaps because it is in fifty seven portions? / Gav: What did I think I'd be able to DO? http://nukees.com/d/20041025.html

Danny: Did you catch the "Big Game," King Luca? We beat Stanford 41-6. We are ranked #4 and may go to the Rose Bowl this year. / King Luca: Citizen Danny, thou hast never strucketh me as the type to take interest in our school's football team. / Danny: Oh, I have spirit. Yes I do. / King Luca: Thy, and others' use of the word, "we" baffles me. Thou art not on the team, nor am I. / King Luca: How wouldst thou appreciate the quarterback taking credit for thine laser-accelerated ion source? / Danny: Again?

Danny: I saw a show on the Discovery Channel last night called "Mythbusters." We should do that! / King Luca: Produce a show on the Discovery Channel? / Danny: No. Bust myths! With science! / Danny: What is the largest, most unbelievable rumor in Berkeley? / King Luca: That there are nuclear engineers on campus. / Danny: True!! This is easy! http://nukees.com/d/20041124.html
http://nukees.com/d/20041126.html
Danny: What is another famous possible myth we could test? We could give elephants a list of phone numbers to memorize and then quiz them? / King Luca: Uh, mayhaps something more accessible, Citizen Danny? / Danny: Like the existence of dark matter? / King Luca: Nay, methinks thou hath moved in the opposite direction. What can we test in this lab without requiring a major grant? / [[Danny is wheeling in a haz-mat barrel]] / King Luca: Or a mixed hazardous waste generator license. / Danny: Then I have got nothing. http://nukees.com/d/20041126.html

But you could...! / [[Gav looks at the paper]] / Cindy Lee: Now there's only one name and her phone number got torn off, but her addess... / Gav: NNRG! / Gav: Sorry, Chicago is off-limits to me... / Cindy Lee: By choice or court order? / Gav: Yes. http://nukees.com/d/20041203.html

He seems to be preoccupied this week testing the existence of a supreme being. / Gav: You go to school in Michigan, don't you?

Keeps getting easier! / Cindy Lee: But... it'll be anarchy! / Gav: Look, I've seen that paper before. Suzy Gee asked me about it. She wants to know who that girl is as much as you do. / Cindy Lee: Then why would she... / Gav: I have an older brother myself.

Gav: So, if he gets sprayed by a hose or a water balloon or something, he gets bigger, because he's a sponge. / Woman: But he lives underwater? / Gav: Exactly! / Gav: So since we're getting along so well, how about heading back to your place for a drink and some physiology experiments? / Woman: Ugh! / Jeannie: [[in the background]] Last call! / Woman: Why do men have to be like that? We just had a pleasant conversation. Isn't that enough? Why does it always have to lead to sex? / Gav: How else do we know if we won? http://nukees.com/d/20041217.html

Jeannie: Have you ever thought about buying one a drink first? / Gav: That would use resources needed for buying ME drinks. / Jeannie: Well then, how about a date? / Gav: I'd love to! / Jeannie: *giggle* Silly! Of course I meant YOU asking one of THEM. You know, girls don't go home with a guy just because he asks. / Gav: I can point to three doing just that right now. / Jeannie: Well sure, if you're looking for a slut... / Gav: I AM! http://nukees.com/d/20041220.html

It's just... / Jeannie: What? / Gav: I just realized I can't really tell you... / Jeannie: Why not? / Gav: Let's just say that my long-term relationship needs are... uh... / Gav: ...reserved. / Jeannie: That'd be the only thing about you that's reserved. / Gav: Kicking while vulnerable!

NO. / Rita: Then you are of little to no use to me. / Gav: LITTLE to no...? / Rita: I suppose you might spontaneously combust... / Gav: Out here, I'm more often struck by lightning. / Rita: Okay, do that. http://nukees.com/d/20041227.html

Rita: You seem dismal. / Gav: I was led astray by promises of an after hours party. / Rita: I LIKE dismal. Why don't we make our OWN after hours? / Gav: Serious? Where do you live? / Rita: I was thinking YOUR place. / Gav: Don't think so. I live in a... hm... Well, why not? You look prepared for the unexpected. / Rita: Cool. CHRIS! I FOUND US A PLACE! / Gav: That's TOO prepared. http://nukees.com/d/20041229.html

Gav: Now WAIT a min-- Who's this "Chris?" / Rita: Don't worry. She's cool. / Gav: [[seeing Chris]] And with THAT, I stopped worrying. / Christine: Hey Rita, the rest of the gang is on the way. / Gav: REST? Whoa, what did I sign onto here? / Rita: It's just my... Uh... Choir group. Shall we? / Gav: I KNOW I'm being set up for something, but I just can't back out until I learn WHAT. http://nukees.com/d/20041231.html
http://nukees.com/d/20050103.html
Gav: So... What? You girls think you're witches, don't you? I'm going to be tied down to a pentagram and ritually bloodletted? / Gav: Or no... You're some kind of vampire larpers, out to... / Rita: What's a "larper?" / Gav: Holy crap, there are MORE of you! / Gav: What? Sorry, I just remembered I'm not familiar with that term. Point being, how much blood will I be losing tonight? / Rita: Oh, no more than a couple pints... / Gav: I can live without that. http://nukees.com/d/20050103.html

Rita: You live in a school building? / Gav: Ah, could be worse, I could live in South Dakota. / Rita: Where do you sleep? / Gav: In my office, of course. Got it wired for cable and everything. / Rita: Really? / Gav: Of course not. I had to get satellite. Oh, but we probably shouldn't wake Danny. / Rita: You have a ROOMMATE?! / Gav: Duh, how else could I afford the rent on a place this size? http://nukees.com/d/20050107.html
http://nukees.com/d/20050110.html
Gav: C'mon, my office is this way. / Rita: But what about your roommate? / Gav: Yeah... I thought about it. We're waking him up. / Rita: Oh? Is he FUN? / Gav: No, I need a witness. / Danny: GAV! Do you realize a supreme being would exist at a temperature of absolute zero? / Rita: He's awake! / Gav: Danny! CHICKS! Stop geeking up the place! http://nukees.com/d/20050110.html
http://nukees.com/d/20050112.html
Gav: Danny! Ixnay on the isicsphay! / Rita: No, don't suppress your friend's curiosity! What have you discovered, Daniel? / Danny: Well it is quite simple, really. Starting from the axiom that supreme beings are omnipresent, via the uncertainty principle, his or her momentum, and thus temperature, approaches zero. / Christine: But only in an infinite universe, assuming the Lord has mass. / Danny: True. / Gav: Oh my god, please tell me you're not here to talk about PHYSICS? / Rita: Oh no. / Rita: We're here to talk about the Lord Jesus Christ! / Gav: [[recoiling like a vampire seeing a cross]] AH! http://nukees.com/d/20050112.html

Jezebel: Hey heathen, where's the booze? / Gav: Uh, in the fridge behind the antidote. / Rita: So let me explain Jesus' love and why you need to be saved. / Julia: [[handing Rita the bible]] The book. / Gav: Sounds like a HOOT. But just a sec. Is it just me or do you girls NOT seem... "Devout"? I mean, look at all this cleavage. / Danny: [[apparently complying with Gav's suggestion]] Okay. / Jezebel: Jesus loves cleavage. / Gav: Well AMEN to THAT. http://nukees.com/d/20050114.html

THAT's a boy who knows how to PARTY! / Jezebel: And I challenge you to find "Thou shalt not suck on a cancerstick" in the Book. / Gav: What about "Thy body is a temple?" / Jezebel: [[blowing smoke in Gav's face]] INCENSE, then. / Gav: I kinda like YOU. http://nukees.com/d/20050117.html

Rita: So tell me, Gav, are you often confused by moral decisions? / Gav: Of others, yes. Whare's Danny? / Rita: He departed with Juila [sic] and Christine. / Gav: Oh no you don't. Divide and convert, eh? Danny's mind and ethics are MINE to manipulate! / Rita: We're going to need thirty pieces of silver. / Jezebel: I'm on it. http://nukees.com/d/20050119.html

Jezebel: I'm not running after him in these heels. / Rita: I'll call Julia and find out where they are. We'll get there before him. / Sign reads: Stairs ----> / Rita: Funny, I've got five bars, but wherever Julia's gone, she's got no signal. They shouldn't have left the building. / Rita: I'd say there's either some wacky science experiment interfering, or they're in the basement. / Jezebel: Can't it be both? Maybe they've got a nuclear reactor in the basement. / Rita: Don't be a smart ass, Jez. http://nukees.com/d/20050121.html
http://nukees.com/d/20050124.html
Danny: Now the postulate of a supreme being involves many variables. We must hypothesize separately the existence of either an "active" or a "passive" god. / Danny: We can subdivide the definition of "active" into "able or not able to circumvent his or her own laws," and yet further consider beings responsible, respectively, for all, some, or none of the laws of physics. / [[Christine raises her hand]] / Danny: Yes? / Christine: What are you writing on the white board? / Danny: I am unsure. It is what I am used to doing. http://nukees.com/d/20050124.html
http://nukees.com/d/20050126.html
Danny: Now, testing an "active" god of the first kind is nigh trivial. We simply look for local violations of the laws of physics. / [[Julia raises her hand]] / Danny: Another question? / Julia: Christianity is based on FAITH. You cannot TEST the Lord's existence. We BELIEVE because we KNOW it to be true in our hearts. / [[Danny turns back to the white board, ignoring the remark.]] / Danny: Now, an "active" god of the second kind may be demonstrated by local closed system decreases in entropy. http://nukees.com/d/20050126.html

Gav: Look, just step aside so I can save my friend before you girls do. / Jezebel: You don't HAVE to feel this way, you know... / Gav: Don't start! Your Jesus voodoo won't wash on me! / Jezebel: I'm just sayin'... Do you LIKE feeling angry all the time? Wouldn't you rather feel LOVE all the time? / Gav: ALL the time? I dunno. How about 15 minutes in the supply closet? / Jezebel: Classy! Feel your own love man-harlot. http://nukees.com/d/20050131.html

Jezebel: Now, you want to know what I find sexy? / Gav: I'm guessing stigmata. But keep it to yourself. I am immune to your persuasion. / Gav: Despite your . . . uh . . . overabundance, you must be chaste. Sans sex, you're nothing to me. / Gav: That curse you call "love" is an evolutionary throwback, doomed only to pain in modern society, like the appendix or armpit hair! / Jezebel: [[holding her left breast]] Yeah . . . something like THAT! / Rita: Jezebel! http://nukees.com/d/20050202.html

Jezebel: He's been hurt in the past. BADLY. / Rita: Forget him. We just have to keep him from the other. / Jezebel: Rita, HE'S the one whoe NEEDS J.C!

Should you not be stealing them? / Gav: Feh, call me when there's a complete exoskeleton...now, the obvious candidate would be the toaster... / Danny: What if a toaster had robot legs? / [[Danny whistling and nailing two boards together.]] http://nukees.com/d/20040709.html

{{Here we see the toaster with robot legs mentioned on July 9th, 2004.}} / Gav: Hey Danny... / Danny: ERG! / Danny: I am trying to get work done! Can you not cease harrasing me for five minutes so I can complete my important funded research!? / Gav: I just wanted to invite you to a poker game, Danny. / Danny: Oh. / Gav: You're nailing two boards together. / Danny: Do not question the goals of the Homeland Security Department! http://nukees.com/d/20040712.html
http://nukees.com/d/20040714.html
Gav: How does this improve national security? / Danny: Homeland Security has supplied inadequate funding for my neutron activation cargo screening system. / Gav: How inadequate? / Danny: The boards are from my desk. / Gav: Huh. You know, they managed to find over $100 billion with which to successfully piss off the Middle East. / Danny: I am aware. / Gav: Well, so long as we're all safer... / Danny: I hit my thumb. http://nukees.com/d/20040714.html

Gav: Hola, el Royal Loco! Is everything ready for the big poker game tonight? / King Luca: Verily! Behold yonder green-felted arena, two sets of laminated casino playing cards, quality clay betting chips... / Gav: PFT! Cards? Chips? A table?! These things are not poker essentials... / Gav: Beer, man! BEER! / King Luca: Oh yeah, I got one. http://nukees.com/d/20040716.html
 
http://nukees.com/d/20040719.html
King Luca: Relax, Gav. There's a six-pack in the fridge. / Gav: A six-pack?! For seven players?! Oh, the carnage! / King Luca: It shall be okay! Guests always bring tribute! / Gav: That's your plan?! Relying on other's generosity? / Gav: Girls never bring beer! Danny doesn't drink anything...Steve and Jerry are underage... none of those losers will supply! / King Luca: Or demand! / Gav: Don't bring economics into it. / King Luca: Thou certainly hath not. http://nukees.com/d/20040719.html

Danny: Look who! / Cecilia: Salutations! / Gav: Did you bring beer? / Cecilia: I brought wine! / Gav: You don't bring wine to a poker game! Would you serve deep-fried twinkees at the opera? / Cecilia: Yeah! / Gav: Cecilia, you weren't even invited to this game. / Cecilia: Please, if I waited to be invited to things, I'd have to spend ALL my time listening to your phone calls on my ham radio... http://nukees.com/d/20040723.html

Gav: This poker game is ruined. I have nothing unrepressed against you Cecilia, but you have to leave. You're strictly "Tier 2" / Cecilia: What? / Gav: The more players, the better, but to play seven-card games with a 52-card deck, we cant have more than seven players. Your presence makes eight. / Gav: Only those friends we can trust to show up are initially invited. They represent the top tier. We invite you "Tier Twos" only if a "Tier One" can't make it. / Cecilia: So...what? I don't get it. Are you running some kind of pyramid scheme? / Gav: Several, but that's unrelated. http://nukees.com/d/20040726.html
http://nukees.com/d/20040728.html
Cecilia: Okay! Let's start the family feud! / Gav: Have you no concept of poker? We can't play with only four players! / Cecilia: Sure we can! Watch: Onesies, onesies, onesies, onesies. Twosies, twosies... / Gav: You don't understand. It just doesn't wor-- / <> / Gav: Hold on. / Gav: WHAT? Oh, you are SO demoted! Tier TWO?! HA! Try Tier FOUR!! That's right! I'll INVENT a tier for your sorry ass to sit on! / Gav: Jerry and Steve just cancelled. / Cecilia: Well there's no need to get all "Tiery Assed" about it! / Danny: "Upon which for your ass of sorrow to sit." http://nukees.com/d/20040728.html

Can I be mad about this? / Cecilia: Actually, you now have to retract your previous anger from when I showed up. http://nukees.com/d/20040730.html
http://nukees.com/d/20040802.html
Cecilia: And "Tier Three" is for "Emergencies Only..." / Cindy Lee: Omigaw! No serious! He made "Tiers?!" / Gav: Who invited girls to a serious poker game, anyway? / King Luca: You did. / Gav: Yeah, but not these... / Cindy Lee: Oh, by the way, I have aces full... don't bother flipping your pocket sevens... / Gav: The girls I invited need a little card to tell them what beats what. / Cecilia: Woo! She wins! Take off your pants!! http://nukees.com/d/20040802.html
http://nukees.com/d/20040804.html
Gav: And...last card face down...Cecilia, you're the hgh hand. It's your bet. / Cecilia: I bet infinity! / Gav: It's a 50 cent max. / Cecilia: Then I fold. / Gav: You can't fold. There's no bet yet! It costs you nothing to check. / Cecilia: Okay, then I bet 50 cents! / Gav: RRGNR! / Cindy Lee: She's good! http://nukees.com/d/20040804.html

There was NO WAY I could beat you! / [[Gav stands up, pressing his hands onto the poker table.]] / Danny: Then do not feel BAD for losing! / Gav: That's not what I -- Danny, why didn't you RAISE?! / [[View from above the table.

She pulls the ring.]] / Cindy Lee: The first is LOCKED! / Luca [[from off-panel]]: Yea! If thou wouldst recall, I instructed thee AGAINST entering. / [[Gav, Cecilia and King Luca sit at the poker table. King Luca drinks from a bottle.]] / Gav: Ah, you never let ANYONE try.

Thank you for the shindig, strange caped man. Gav, I assume I'll see you tomorrow. / Gav: Looks like the party's wrapping up. How disappointing. / King Luca: Dideth thee not have a regal time? / Gav: Yeah, but wasn't it relatively uneventful? I was hoping we might show Jeannie a little more...

Suzy Gee: Hee hee! Did you see their faces when you said we were jumping on the bed? Good save! / Cecilia: We WERE jumping on the bed! / Suzy Gee: That was EARLIER!

And fasten your blouse, you flirt! / Suzy Gee: The point is, I don't KNOW what's in the treasure room. Luca would never let me see. It must be something he wants to KEEP from me. / Cecilia: Maybe his wine! / Suzy Gee: Well aren't you just as cute as the button, you little *hic* tramp. http://nukees.com/d/20040206.html

I mean, it's crazy that they SHOWED UP! / King luca: Yes, I'm quite proud of Duchess Suzy. She hath learned to harden her heart against the horrors of the world. / King Luca: And she can thank THEE for teaching her of those! / Gav: Oh, har har! http://nukees.com/d/20040211.html

Gav: "Hardened her heart," huh? Funny, King Luca.

Suzy Gee: Anyway, I gotta get to class. Now you keep my secret and I won't tell anyone you used a contraction... / Danny: That is unfair.
