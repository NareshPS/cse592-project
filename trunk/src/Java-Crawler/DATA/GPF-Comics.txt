No more hacker problems I assume...? / Sharon: Haven't logged in yet, Fred. Now what is this? / [[Sharon reads a paper in the package]] / Sharon: A disassembled hard drive? "The test has begun.

It could be something important. / Fred: Or a big waste of time... / [[Sharon bending over toward computer]] / Sharon: I'll put the drive together and hook it up to this machine.

[[Fred is perched atop a filing cabinet next to Sharon's desk]] / Sharon: Okay, let me see if I get this straight... / Sharon: Almost four years ago, Fooker got this exact same test from some ubergeek organization calling itself the Brotherhood of the Twisted Pair. He passed the test, and was about to be inducted as a member... / Sharon: ... When you gallantly intervened and saved him from certain doom. / Fred: Something like that. / Sharon: Uh huh. / Sharon: Since then, this brotherhood has marked him as an enemy, and even challenged him to a Quake 3 deathmatch... / Fred: Which ended in a draw. / Sharon: Hm. So yesterday's hack attempt was meant to target him, not GPF. / Fred: But if they sent you the test, they must know now that you're not Fooker. / Sharon: Heh... which gives us ample opportunity to mess with their heads. / Fred: There!

We'll be reading these files in no time... / Fred: Sharon, you don't have to do this... / Sharon: Do what? / Fred: Avenge Fooker. There's no need for you to get mixed in with the brotherhood. It's his problem, not yours. / Sharon: They sent me this test, so now they are my problem. Besides, nobody messes with my man or my servers. / Fred: (thinking) Good thing I didn't tell her about me short-circuiting that hub last week. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20030915.html

Looks like I'll have to do this the messy way. / Good Trish: B-but *why*? / Bad Trish: I doubt your tiny little brain could fathom it, kid.

She's not in here anywhere I can see. / Ki: This is so strange. Where did she go, and why did she leave? / Sharon: I don't like this, Ki. I think we've been here far too long.

This "new" Trish was so different from the "old" Trish, it's hard to say she's the same person. / Dexter: I wish I knew what happened that night I left Luigi's with her. / Sharon: Well, she obviously didn't harm you, but that's another mystery unsolved. / Ki: You should've seen her, Nick. She seemed to have no real memory of meeting us, of the dinner, of even working at Goodman Rubber.

I didn't want to deceive you, but it was for your own good. I'll try to explain, but just please don't quit working here! / Dexter: Well... okay. But I get to strangle that goatee off Fooker's face when I see him again... / Sharon: Trust me, you'll have to stand in line... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20031025.html

If we continue to have problems, I'll pursue stronger disciplinary actions. / [[Dwayne pulls out the employee handbook]] / Fred: He actively tried to kill me! / Dwayne: He didn't know his actions were so dangerous to you. Besides, I followed the rules I set in the employee handbook. / [[Fred takes the handbook]] / Fred: Let me see that... / Dwayne: Everyone gets a chance to straighten up and fly right. I can arrange for you two not to have contact if you're uncomfortable. / [[Fred reads the handbook]] / Fred: Well... okay.

The past is the past. / Sharon: And your obsession with Megan Morrone? / Dexter: Implanted by Fooker to keep me away from you. I think I have that under control. / Sharon: Good.

I'm sorry I toyed with your noggin. Part of it was official, but I'll admit the Sharon part was selfish and unfair. I was jealous that you could stay here with her and I couldn't. / Fooker: But let me try to put it another way: Do you really believe that if I hadn't wiped your memories that Sharon would have run back into your arms? / Dexter: Well... No... / Fooker: Then see?

Dexter: You won't be hiring Fooker back? / Dwayne: Not right away, at least. In a few months, maybe. / Dwayne: We don't have the budget to support another employee yet, although I'm looking into expanding our projects, which would warrant hiring a few more people. / Dwayne: Besides, if Fooker were to replace anyone, it would have to be Sharon, since she's sys admin. And I don't think any of us would want to see that. / Fooker: Definitely not. / Dexter: Yes!

If the deals Trent and I are working on come through, we'll be able to double our staff. And we'll need at least two sys admins. I can bring you back as the senior admin. / Dwayne: Until then, I have a friend across town who heads the I/T department for a local telecom firm. He's looking for a sys admin, and I told him about you as soon as we found out you were back. / Dwayne: I'll set up an interview, but with the glowing reference I've given, it'll only be a formality. / Fooker: A telecom, huh?

So I have remained here, and have become a resident doctor in this city. / [[Akhilesh walking down a corridor]] / Akhilesh: I have an apartment, such as it is, but I rarely return to it.

Yet I am driven to aid those in peril, who cling to life by the thinnest of threads, many of whom will never remember my name. / [[View of a patient in the room with the window]] / Akhilesh: Somehow...

Even if I wanted to, I could never forget. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040726.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040727.html
[[Policeman and Akhilesh stand over the patient]] / Akhilesh: The police found you, naked and left for dead, tossed in a dumpster only a few blocks away. No I.D. or distinguishing marks could be found. / [[Akhilsesh works on the patient, with the police looking on]] / Akhilesh: There was an obvious bullet wound, but surprisingly little loss of blood. In fact, the wound was almost cauterized. That was when things became truly bizarre. / [[Akhilesh examines the projectile, while police take fingerprints in the background]] / Akhilesh: I removed the projectile, but you remained in your coma. Since you appeared stable, the police insisted on getting your fingerprints to try and identify you. / [[Police look startled at the fingerprints]] / Akhilesh: That's when we discovered your fingerprints were *changing*, almost every time they were checked. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040727.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040728.html
[[A finger with print visible is held up to a form, showing that it doens't match the print left on the form]] / Akhilesh: It seemed impossible, but it was true. Your fingerprints, dental and iris patterns, even the shape of your face was changing at an alarming pace! / [[Akhilesh looks through a microscope]] / Akhilesh: Since you were stable for the moment, I turned my attention to the projectile. It was unlike any bullet I had ever seen, and I managed to make a fantastic discovery before the police confiscated it as evidence:... / [[View of the patient's blood, with tiny machines visible among the bloodcells]] / Akhilesh: The bullet was filled with microscopic machines--nanoprobes--beyond any science I had heard of. By now, trillions of these devices were coursing through your blood stream... / [[Akhilesh looks startled at the limp form of the patient in the next room.]] / Akhilesh: and if my hypothesis was correct, they were rewriting your very DNA at the molecular and atomic level! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040728.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040729.html
[[Akhilesh looks at the blood]] / Akhilesh: My mind raced at the implications. Obviously, someone sought to murder you, and if the bullet did not kill you, the nanoprobes would disassemble you from the inside out! / [[Akhilesh watches the police examining the patient in the next room]] / Akhilesh: It was horribly ingenious, I will admit. Even if the corpse were to be found, it would deteriorate to an unrecognizable state far faster than decomposition. The perfect murder. / [[Akhilesh sits at his desk, contemplating the situation]] / Akhilesh: All we would eventualy be left with would be a puddle of goo... base chemicals and amino acids. And your murderer would get away... well, with murder. / [[Akhilesh looking determined.]] / Akhilesh: There are two things he did not count on, however. You were fighting the infection. And if you would not give up, then neither would I. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040729.html

[[A pair of tweezers hold up a single strand of hair]] / Akhilesh: I managed to find a hair folicle that was still alive (sorry, but your hair was falling out anyway) and used it to isolate your original DNA as best as I could. / [[Akhilesh stands at the shoulder of a female co-worker, as they work on a cure]] / Akhilesh: Using this, I replicated it, and submitted it to a friend who works in gene therapy. Together, we devised an experimental procedure to restore your DNA. / [[The patient lays in bed with a drip in her arm]] / Akhilesh: But first we had to destroy the nanoprobes, or the therapy would be worthless. I found a form of chemotherapy that seemed to work, although it would dangerously weaken your immune system. / [[Akhilesh kneels beside the patient's bed holding her hand, praying]] / Akhilesh: Miraculously, it seemed to work! The probes are disappearing. Maybe we were lucky, but pardon me if I think my prayers had more than a little to do with it. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040730.html

[[Akhilesh stands inside the door of the patient's room]] / Akhilesh: The police still have not identified you yet. They have your DNA, but it does not match any reported missing person. / [[Akhilesh with his eyes closed]] / Akhilesh: Since you have no identity, the hospital refused to pay for your treatment, so I am paying it myself. I saved some for my sister's operation, but once she passed away... well, I am not using it. / [[Akhilesh kneels by the patient's bed and holds her hand]] / Akhilesh: You have held on so long, I assume you have *some* reason to fight for life. I want you to know, no matter what it is, I will fight with you, you are not alone. / [[Patient is visible in background, her features fuzzy. In the foreground, a pair of glasses with distinctive trapezoidal rims sits on a table, one lens shattered]] / Akhilesh: With God on our side, we are never alone. / {{End...?}} http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040731.html

I take it you've had a change of plans? / / Fred: I've decided not to sue Trent. It's just not worth the hassle. / Nicole: Personally, I'm glad. What brought you to this decision? / Fred: Well, I've talked it over with Dwayne some more, and I think it's something we can work out. Plus there's too much risk involved. A lawsuit could expose Persephone and me to unwanted scrutiny. / You'll still get paid, of course... / Nicole: Oh, I'm not worried about that. I thought the risk outweighed your vindication.

The most elite hackers began to find each other, despite real world distances... / [[Four members of the brotherhood stand in robes and shadows]] / Scott: Soon we began to isolate ourselves from the noobz, script kiddies, and wannabes. We formed a secret society devoted to the purity of hacking, where only the best of the best could enter. / [[A person sits in front of a computer]] / Scott: All was fine until Google put a near full archive of usenet online. A brother known as "thePROPH3T" analyzed the decades of posts and made a startling revelation: a prophecy hidden between the flame wars and the "me too" posts... / [[A person stands, arms outstretched, between the world and a glowing computer]] / Scott: One day, a hacker will arise like none other, whose skills are without equal. He (or she) will initiate a golden age of geekdom, and lead a revolution of ideas that will transform the computerized world... / [[Patty and Tim are in the office, listening to Scott]] / Patty: Does he always go off on exposition like this? / Tim: Not always, but once he gets started... / Scott: Do you mind? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040829.html

[[Robed members of the brotherhood stand in conversation]] / Scott: The prophecy of the one was not well received. Many called it rubbish, or at least a bad "Matrix" or "Babylon 5" reference. This was the first sign of fractures in the brotherhood. / [[Scott stands by a computer, hood down]] / Scott: At first I too was skeptical. But then "thePROPH3T" showed me his evidence. As Zero One, the duly elected leader, I made finding the one one of our long-term goals. / Scott: If the one came from the brotherhood (a natural assumption, given our quality of membership), it would place us in an unprecedented position of power, far above the "suits" we usually serve in our day jobs... / [[Patty and Tim are listening to Scott]] / Patty: Not to appear at all interested in where this is going, but what does this have to do with that Barker guy? / Scott: I'm getting to it! Patience, wench! / Tim: Um, she doesn't like to be called "wench." http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040830.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040831.html
[[Fooker and Fred are surrounded by robed members of the brotherhood]] / Scott: Barker came to us in November of 1999. He seemed to be a promising initiate, but nothing more. He passed our tests and joined us... only briefly. / Scott: Shortly after his initiation, he insulted us, then spoke the name of the "great evil." He was immediately expelled from the order and became our mortal enemy. / [[A robed Scott faces the down-turned thumbs of the other brotherhood members]] / Scott: It was only then that "thePROPH3T" showed me how closely Barker matched the qualities of the one. I tried to reinstate him, but the brothers had already banned his name from even being spoken. / [[Patty and Tim listen to Scott]] / Patty: The "great evil?" Who's that? Oh, let me guess... Bill Gates? / Scott: Grah! You try my patience, woman! / Tim: Um, she doesn't like to be called "woman" like that either... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040831.html

[[Tim and Patty listen to Scott tell the history of the Brotherhood of the Twisted Pair]] / Scott: If I may continue uninterrupted... / Patty: Sor-ry. / Scott: That incident amplified the rift among us. Some in the brotherhood questioned my leadership. / [[Picture of Fooker as a Quake character]] / Scott: Chief among them was Greg, who led a band of brothers in a Quake deathmatch against Barker. I did not sanction the act, but there was little I could do to stop it. / [[Scott faces the brotherhood in council about Sharon]] / Scott: The final straw came when the only other candidate for the one surfaced: Sharon Murphy, also of GPF Software, and a woman. Greg and his followers could not accept that a female could be the one, and called for a vote of no confidence. / Scott: But an RIAA/FBI raid did more damage than Greg ever could. The brotherhood was scattered, and only Tim and a few others came back to me. We have continued our quest in secret... until now. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040901.html

[[Scott tells Patty about the Brotherhood of the Twisted Pair]] / Scott: The brotherhood as it began has ended, but the quest for the one has only just begun, and I will continue it with or without the brotherhood. / Scott: Either Barker or Murphy must be the one. Of that I am certain. In all the 'net I have found none to match their skills, and I retained enough resources to make that search thorough. / Scott: We have watched Murphy carefully. She is wise and has done much to protect her networks. Even I have failed to hack into her work or home machines. The one she may be, but she has yet to be truly tested. / Scott: Barker, however, vanished after his murder trial. I never believed in his guilt, but his disappearance is troubling. Wherever he went, he is back, and I will not rest until I know if he is the one... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040902.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040903.html
[[Scott, Tim, and Patty are in the office]] / Patty: So how can you tell if this Barker guy is "the one" you keep rambling on about? / Tim: The prophecy lists a number of tests to identify the one. / Scott: Barker passed all the rites of initiation, and did so in record time. His skills have also surpassed all those in the brotherhood that he went up against. These alone point to his prowess... / Scott: But "thePROPH3T" found a series of trials that would show us clearly if he is destined for glory. / Patty: Whatever. Let's get this over with then. / Tim: Wait a minute... you're interested in joining and helping us now? / Patty: Not really, but it beats doing real work... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040903.html

[[Scott, Tim, and Patty hide around a corner as Fooker walks to William]] / Scott: Little does William know, but he shall facilitate Barker's next phase of testing, thanks to a few anonymous calls to procurement... / [[Fooker talks to William]] / William: Since there's no way procurement will get those new servers in by the deadline, we're stuck using this legacy equipment for low-end processing. / Fooker: No sweat. What have we got? / William: About four PDP-11/94s, a small Vax 6000 cluster, and a couple of Apple IIe's we can use for terminals. / Fooker: You have got to be joking... / William: I wish I were. / Fooker: Fine. Order three large "everything" pizzas and a six-pack of Red Bull, then download the latest Linux kernel source. I've got some cables to splice... / Tim: Do you really think even the one could turn that into a powerful modern server cluster? / Scott: Only if you believe in miracles, Tim... / Patty: Oh, I can just smell the drama... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040905.html

That test alone should prove he is worthy... / Scott: There is more to come. The other brothers should start phase 3 any minute... / [[Amy runs for Fooker]] / Amy: Are you the new sys admin? We've got a massive DDoS attack hitting one of our switches! Half the voice and data network for the state is down! / Fooker: Man... I haven't even had time to get claustrophobic in my cube yet.

No vi, no emacs, not even ex, ed, or even pico... / [[Scott, Tim, and Patty watch Fooker from the edge of the cubicles]] / Patty: Oh, let me guess. You can tell what kind of geek he is by which editor he downloads and installs, right? / Scott: You could say that... / Fooker: Eh. Never liked any of those anyway. I'll just write my own for grins and giggles. / Scott: (thinking) Just the answer I was looking for... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040907.html

I'm really impressed with how you handled that hacker... want to grab some dinner after work, then check out my software? / Amy: I said, why don't you come back to my place, you can scan my ports, and we can interface our input/output in nice rhythmic cycles... / Amy: Hey, Mr. Oblivious.

[[Patty, Tim, and Scott watch Fooker at his computer as Amy walks off]] / Scott: Yes! He is at one with his computer! Timothy, send him the e-mail I forwarded to you. / Tim: On it. / Fooker: Huh... already got mail. That's odd... it seems to be some sort of odd code. It could be encrypted, or some weird assembler... / Fooker: Ya know, I've got a ton of stuff to do and it's almost quittin' time, so I'll just leave that nugget to look at tomorrow... / [[Scott and Tim look surprised]] / Patty: Darn it, now you got me curious. So did he pass this test? / Patty: Guys? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040909.html

[[Patty, Scott, and Tim are talking outside Fooker's cubicle]] / Patty: What? What's wrong? He didn't pass? / Scott: H-he... he didn't decode the message. / Tim: B-but that proves nothing! / Tim: He didn't fail, because he didn't fail to decode it. He just didn't try. / Patty: But what's wrong with that? He's had a long day, and he put it off until tomorrow. So? / Scott: You don't understand, Patricia. Even a mild geek would be curious about such a mystery. But the one should be insatiably curious. He would drop everything to discover its meaning. / Scott: He has shown promise, but perhaps I was wrong. Undoubtedly, Barker is not the one... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20040910.html

[[Patty, Scott, and Tim are talking outside of Fooker's cubicle]] / Patty: So now what will you do? / Scott: We will test Murphy. If Barker is not the one, then perhaps she is. / Tim: Don't give up hope, Scott. The one may not manifest himself in our lifetime. We'll continue to search, and if the source is willing, we will find him someday. / Scott: I know, Tim. It's just I had such... high hopes for Barker... / Fooker: Ya know, I've got a couple minutes.

Ah, 5 in an AT, 6 in a mini. / Mr. Oshiro: Do not forget to pick up your tee. / Nick: (thinking) Should I upgrade my 100base-T to gigabit ethernet? / Ki: You don't seem quite as dazed and confused as you were earlier. / Nick: When you don't have a clue what's going on, your mind wanders to the familiar... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041002.html

[[Ki is in the kitchen with her mother]] / Mrs. Oshiro: You are back! How did things go? / Ki: Pretty bad. Dad was two under par, I was five over, and Nick... was over by an order of magnitude... / Mrs. Oshiro: I meant between father and Nick. / Ki: I know, and the results were about the same. They're so different. They barely spoke, but at least Nick tried. I'm afraid of what will happen next... / Mrs. Oshiro: How so? / Ki: I'm afraid Nick is going to ask dad for my hand in marriage, and dad will go ballistic. / Ki: You don't seem surprised... / Mrs. Oshiro: That your Nick will propose? No. Though he tries, he does not hide things well, which is how you know, I suspect. / Ki: Yeah, I've thought so for a while, but I can tell now that he wanted to honor and appeal to dad first. I'm proud of him and touched for that. I'm just worried it's going to backfire. / Mrs. Oshiro: You know, it is the 21st century.

Domo arigato gozaimasu. / [[Nick continues to bow]] / Nick: I would ask for a few moments of your time, if it is not an inconvenience to you. I have a matter of great importance I wish to discuss with you. / Nick: Your time is valuable, so I will only ask -- / Mr. Oshiro: Perhaps you should bow lower, gaijin.

I only meant to honor you, not bother you. / Mr. Oshiro: Honor me? You call your incessant groveling "honor"? / Mr. Oshiro: I know your kind, gaijin. You watch japanimation, then you become a fanatic and believe you know all there is of Japan. You speak of honor with only the faintest notion of what it truly is. / Nick: I fail to see what watching anime has to do with this... / Mr. Oshiro: It was your kind that added that annoying "7-zark-7" to "Gatchaman"... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041005.html

It is also with respect that I seek your blessing on another topic dear to us both. / Mr. Oshiro: You need not my blessing for anything. / Nick: On this, I feel I do. Your daughter is very special to me, and she has blessed my life more than words can express. I know that she cares for me as much as I care for her.

Stick to your own kind, and you will be better off. / Nick: Ki was never a trophy to me, and she is old enough to make her own decisions. Race has never been a consideration in our mutual agreement to date each other. / Mr. Oshiro: Then perhaps it should be! You young Americans sicken me, diluting yourselves until you can no longer identify your lineage! You preach diversity while slowly blending your genes to conformity! / [[Mr. Oshiro picks up his cane]] / Nick: And this comes from a Japanese man who married a Chinese woman?

He takes what little he gleans from cartoons and pretends to know our ways and culture! / Ki: That sounds nothing like Nick! If anything, I'd bet he spend weeks, if not months, doing research, trying to find ways to honor you. He knew you highly valued Japanese culture and wanted to show an interest in it. / Mr. Oshiro: Then he should have researched more!

Did you ever stop to think that you are stereotyping them just as you accuse them of stereotyping you? / [[Mr. Oshiro motions as if to say something, but stops]] / Mr. Oshiro: You... you are not allowed to make more sense than me in an argument! / Ki: Well, I'm not about to play stupid, so you better catch up, dad. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041013.html

I've grown since Sam, and I know I'm right this time. But you won't even give Nick a chance. / Mr. Oshiro: Kyo--Ki-chan, I am your father. I only want what is best for you.

You are still sleeping on the couch tonight. / Ki: My point is that I don't need nakoudo. I don't need someone to find a husband for me. Nick has brought more joy to my life than anyone. I know I'm making the right choice. / Ki: You two did not have nakoudo; you met here, in America, and you fell in love. You didn't let your differences stand between your love. If Japanese and Chinese can find happiness, then why not Asian and American? / Ki: I'm going to marry Nick, whether you approve of it or not.

And that's why I'm here. / s1r3n: My pursuers have stepped up the chase. They've hounded me closer since we last met than before. I'll bet they've had you bugged, and were using you to track me. / [[s1r3n points at Yoshi's capsule]] / Yoshi: Huh?

How "sloppy" they were, missing or ignoring things? / s1r3n: Well, it wasn't the FBI. It's an ultra-covert spy organization, and they are not sloppy. I guarantee everything they "missed" was thoroughly copied and put back where you hid them, so you wouldn't notice. / Yoshi: Th-then all my files... / s1r3n: Relax, kid. They don't care about your file swapping or hacking. They wanted me, and you were an easy conduit. / Yoshi: My files were stolen by government spies.

Both I and the UGA used you, but at least I'll apologize. / Yoshi: This bug... I found it in the machine I built for you... / s1r3n: It's a tracker. Don't destroy it, or they'll know you found it. But if you ever move the device, make sure that isn't in it. / Yoshi: The device. I did tell you I finished it... / s1r3n: No, you didn't. But now that you have, I'm sorry I made you build it. I should never have involved you. / [[s1r3n looks away and starts to cry]] / Yoshi: Then what do you want me to do with it? / s1r3n: Destroy it, and keep yourself from making the same mistakes I made... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041020.html

I won't risk your life for one as worthless as mine. / s1r3n: I have only one hope left. Somewhere out there, I have a sister who my mother put up for adoption. She may turn me in, or she may help me. I don't know. But she's all I have left. / Yoshi: You can have my sister, for all I care. I certainly don't want her... / s1r3n: Heh...

[[Fooker and Agent #12 are in their hotel room]] / Agent #12: Dr. Not won't be alone. Reports have a couple of henchmen with her, as well as someone in her employ known only as "The German." / Fooker: Yes, I've heard of him. True identity unknown, he is a master of disguise and can completely assume his quarry's identity. His research is impeccably thorough. / Agent #12: UGA HQ has no guess as to why Not needs him. My guess is she'll have him replace someone at the conference, but with thousands in attendance, it's impossible to know who. / Agent #12: Sigh... you're lost in geekland again, aren't you? / Fooker: I wonder if they'll have a LAN.

"I'm tired, Maddie," "I miss my friends, " "I miss hacking..." It seems like that's all you talk about when we're alone. And those transmissions you've been making... / Fooker: I don't know what you're talking about. / Agent #12: Like heck. You've sent a number of encoded messages to someone called "Gemini."

Dwayne: Ladies, can I have a word with you for a few minutes? / Ki: Sure thing, Dwayne! / Dwayne: Trent just secured a quick little development project for us. Normally, I would have Nick manage it as project lead, but he has his hands full with the Dippin' Doughnuts project. / Dwayne: Ki, you have the most seniority, as well as the most database and development experience that will be invaluable for this project. / Ki: No problem. I'll get started on the paperwork. / Dwayne: Actually, I need your developer's skills, Ki. That's one reason I'm making _Sharon_ the project lead. / Sharon: Whozawhatzit? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041109.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041110.html
Sharon: You're making me the project lead over KI? / Dwayne: Yes, I know this will be your first lead assignment, but it's a great opportunity. / Dwayne: When we lost Fooker, we lost both a sys admin AND a developer. I know you haven't done much development work, but you did manage some admin projects back at Quantum-Net. / Dwayne: Once we score that big contract we're working on, we'll hire more people and all of our existing staff will move up. I want some experience under your belt before that happens. / Dwayne: So if you manage and Ki develops, that won't be too awkward, will it? / Ki: [[looks awkwardly at Sharon]] Um, sure. / Sharon: [[looks awkwardly at Ki]] Not at all. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041110.html

Sharon: Are you SURE you don't mind that Dwayne has me as project lead instead of you? / Ki: I'm a little surprised, but I understand his reasons. / Ki: Look, I've led a few projects before, so if you need any advice, just ask. Meanwhile, I'll enjoy taking a break from SQL to get some heavier-duty code slinging done. / Sharon: Well, as Dwayne said, I did lead a few projects at Quantum, so I'm not a TOTAL noob. / Ki: I didn't say you were. I was just offering in case it was needed. / Sharon: Well, it SHOULDN'T be.

http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041112.html
Sharon: Okay! Let's get an overview of our new project. It's a quick shopping cart system for an existing customer, so we already have a foundation. / Sharon: Dexter, I want you to start laying out the PHP code while Ki starts building the database. Meanwhile, I'll tackle the server config. / Ki: Can I make a suggestion? / Ki: We might want to design the DB first. That gives Dexter a place to start and you an idea of if we'll need a server upgrade. / Sharon: But it's more time efficient this way. / Ki: Not if Dex has to rewrite code if he guesses my design incorrectly. / Sharon: Well, that's why you have to COMMUNICATE. / Dexter: Oh, boy... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041112.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041113.html
Sharon: Look, Dex can layout a good bit of the front end without knowing the DB design. He can use the Goodman Rubber store as a guideline. / Ki: I'm all for reusing code, but the Goodman design is overkill for this project. This system needs to be simple and fast; that system is too bloated in this case. / Sharon: But we need to be forward thinking. What if they want to expand later? / Ki: EXPAND? It's a funeral parlor! What are they going to expand into? / Dex: Um, why does a funeral home need an online shopping cart anyway? / Sharon and Ki: STAY OUT OF THIS! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041113.html

Trent: Hey, Nick! Listen to this article comparing male and female managers... / Nick: They actually make a magazine called "Managers Illustrated"? / Trent: It says that since men are used to a hierarchical structure, they adjust quickly to changes in management. But women are born collaborators, and don't adapt as easily to highly structured organizations. / Trent: What's really curious is how strong female personalities react. They adjust more quickly than other women to the corporate world, usually by taking leadership roles. / Trent: But if two strong-willed women are placed on the same team, they often clash and create conflict. Strong willed men, on the other hand, simply fall into line. / Nick: You don't actually believe all that, do you, Trent? / Trent: Eh, who knows? But there COULD be a kernel of truth to it all... / Sharon: Look, this is MY project, so we'll do it MY way! / Ki: Even though YOUR way is so obviously WRONG? / Dexter: [[cowering]] Mommy? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041114.html

Mercedes: Is that where you found he defendant's supposed libelous remarks? / Trent: Y-yes. I knew it was angry, but I had no idea it was so... venomous. / Trent: It started out using a pseudonym for me. But it was obvious who it was talking about. So I got on its forums and attempted to defend myself. But it promptly banned me and kept posting, this time calling me by name! / Mercedes: Then let us examine the blog and forum in quesiton. I present exhibits A and B, a transcript of these texts. And the server logs subpoenaed from the defendant's web host. / Judge: Hm... The defendant has, um, quite a vocabulary... / Fred: Why, thank you your- er, sorry. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050719.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050720.html
Mercedes: The counsel for the plaintiff readily admits the vast majority of the defendant's remarks in the blog are opinion or hyperbole and therefore cannot be considered defamatory. / Mercedes: However, there are several remarks highlighted for the court that call into question the plaintiff's competence in the workplace. But most damaging is the last one, that the plaintiff is a "homicidal maniac." / Mercedes: Mr. Terrell, out of curiosity, ARE you a homicidal maniac? / Trent: Absolutely not! That's completely absurd! I've never murdered anyone! / Mercedes: Yet the defendant claims you are. How can we explain this? / Trent: Obviously, it misinterpreted my innocent pranks as "death threats." Which they certainly were not. I never intended to do any sort of lasting harm to anyone. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050720.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050721.html
Mercedes: By converse, has the defendant ever attempted to cause bodily harm to YOU? / Trent: I'm... loathe to mention it. But yes, it ASSAULTED me a few months ago. / Mercedes: If you can bear to do so, please explain. / Trent: I was minding my own business in my office when it violated a restraining order and took over my body. / Mercedes: Took over your body? / Trent: Somehow it gained access to my body and made me perform degrading, embarassing acts. It even got me arrested! / Nicole whispers: I TOLD you that would come back to haunt you... / Fred whispers: If I go to jail over THAT, it'd be worth it. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050721.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050722.html
Mercedes: Have these incidents affected your ability to perform your job? / Trent: Sadly, yes. I am a salesman. A marketing guru. So reputation and appearance are everything. / Trent: I communicate extensively online, but I've found this undue stigma precedes me. I cannot represent our company effectively this way. We nearly lost a critical new client due to this incident. / Mercedes: And do you believe the defendant exhibited malice through these incidents? / Trent: Absolutely! I'm convinced its unwavering hatred of me was its motivation to attack. / Mercedes: So the defendant knew its statements were false and recklessly disregarded the truth to destroy your career? / Trent: I believe so, yes. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050722.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050723.html
Fred whispers: So, um... Are we doing as bad as I THINK we're doing? / Nicole whispers: Not necessarily. So far Mercedes hasn't pulled anything I didn't expect. / Nicole whispers: She's going out of her way to discredit the "murder" claim but I'm ready for that. Of course, we could have done without the "remote control" bit... / Fred whispers: One moment of weakness... / Fred whispers: Trent's coming down. Who will she call next? / Nicole whispers: My guess? YOU. She'll try to manipulate your answers, so word your responses carefully. / Nicole whispers: We've got a chance of winning... if you don't give her the rope to hang you with. / Mercedes: Next, I call the defendant to the stand. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050723.html

Fred: Thanks for the lift. It would have taken me forever to ooze over there... / Bailiff: ew... / Fred: Don't worry. It won't stain. / Bailiff: Raise your right... um... / [[Fred oozes out a right open palm, face out]] / Fred: Does this help? / Bailiff: Do you swear or affirm you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? / Fred: I do. / Mercedes: "Mr." Physarum... IS it "MR."? Or is it "Miss" Physarum? / Fred: Technically, I am sexless. Yet I prefer the use of masculine identifiers. / Mercedes: Mr. Physarum, how exactly did a slime mold become employed at GPF software? / Fred: After I was fired from my previous job, Ki Oshiro convinced Mr. Duncan to hire me. / Mercedes: I see. And what was your previous occupation? / Fred: An online literature professor. / Mercedes: And why were you fired...? / Fred: I... didn't have the credentials to teach there. / Mercedes: Were those credentials somehow revoked? / Fred: Um... No, they were somehow forged to begin with. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050724.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050725.html
Mercedes: Obtaining employment using falsified records is hardly reputable, Mr. Physarum... / Fred: I agree, but given my unique situation I didn't see much of an alternative. / Mercedes: So I take it you have no qualms with breaking the law when it no longer suits your needs? / Nicole: OBJECTION! / Judge: Sustained. / Mercedes: My apologies, Your Honor. Let us move on to the incident in question. Were you or were you not the author of the blog in exhibit A? / Fred: I am. / Mercedes: You seem unapologetic about your statements. / Fred: I stand behind them 100%. Well, I don't "stand" behind them, obviously, but you get the idea... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050725.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050726.html
Mercedes: Then is it true you banned the plaintiff from your forums to prevent him from defending himself? / Fred: I banned him because he was being abusive and disruptive to the other posters. / Mercedes: Are you CERTAIN your argument with the plaintiff had no bearing on this ban? It's timing hardly seems objective. you mean to say that anger played ABSOLUTELY no part in that decision? / Fred: Can I honestly say that? No. But I made a decision I thought was in the best interests of my readers. If I was also angry... Well, it's never a good idea to tick off the guy with admin privileges. / Mercedes: Then let me phrase it another way. Do you think you have a problem with anger? / Fred: Why do I get the feeling that if I say no, I'll get hit with a giant mallet? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050726.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050727.html
Fred: Are you insinuating I have an anger management problem? / Mercedes: Insinuating? No. But I would like to enter exhibit C for consideration. / Mercedes: These are selected past entries from the defendant's archive, displaying numerous "rants" about students and faculty at his college, literary works he consideres overrated, etc. Although none are libelous, they do highlight his propensity for anger. / Mercedes: Did you indeed author these posts as well? / Fred: Er, yes. / Mercedes: And how would you describe the overall tone? / Fred: Angry. / Mercedes: So, am I insinuating you have an anger management problem? / Fred: Dang. And you had to use one of those clamp-like paper clips, since it's so thick... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050727.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050728.html
So anger was a non-dismissable factor in your banning of the plaintiff from your forumas, and you have a history of anger issues. / So I have a short fuse. So what? / Tell me, Mr. Physarum. Were you angry at the plaintiff when you posted the blog entry in question? / Of course! / And you would have done anything to seek revenge? / Of course not! There are certain lines I would never cross! / That seems unlikely. If fraud is not out of your bounds, then why should libel be? / Objection! The counsel is leading the witness! / Sustained. / No further questions. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050728.html

Fooker: Man, that questioning was brutal. / Sharon: It's a good thing the judge called a recess. / Ki: How are you holding up, Fred? You seem to be sliming more than usual... / Fred: I do that when I'm really nervous. Think of it as my version of a cold sweat. / Nick: Nicole, what do you think are his chances? / Mercedes: Our strategy is still sound. We've just got a few more land mines to avoid. / Fooker: I could use my influence with the judge to sway things in Fred's favor... / Fred: I'd rather be carted off to Wisebottom's lab for study... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050729.html

As the counsel for the plaintiff rests her case, the court adjourns for a brief recess. We, of course, will continue our live coverage of the trial. / Have you heard about the marketing exec suing a slime mold for libel? Next I hear Boston Market is suing botulism and salmonella for defamation of character... / So you have no comment on your association with "Dr." Physarum? / Sleek, shiny, and slimey is definitely in, and green is the new black! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050730.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050731.html
Judge: Counsel for the defense...? / Nicole: I call Dr. Otto Wisebottom to the stand. / Nicole: Dr. Wisebottom, you have examined the defendant. What is your scientific evaluation? / Dr. Wisebottom: Well, although we do not currently have a biological classification for him, I would say "slime mold" is a close enough approximation. / Dr. Wisebottom: Of course, his genetic structure is unlike any of the 650 or myxogastrids and dicyostelids that-- / Nicole: Thank you, Dr. And what was your evaluation of his intelligence? / Dr. Wisebottom: Fred is an extremely fascinating subject. Although he does indeed appear to be a single-celled organism, he has also developed a very complex distributed nucleus that functions much like the neural net of the human brain. / Dr. Wisebottom: Although IQ tests are far from perfect, the results I gathered are quite clear: Fred is not only sentient, but also sapient. A thinking, rational being with an intelligence above the human average. I assert these findings are accurate and true. / Nicole: And what is your personal assessment of the defendant? / Dr. Wisebottom: He is a joy to fellowship with. He is ruthless at "Monopoly" and has a marvelous singing voice... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050731.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050801.html
Nicole: How long have you known the defendant, Mr. Barker? / Fooker: Almost seven years. / Nicole: And what is your association with him? / Fooker: We're roommates. / Nicole: Describe your relationship. / Fooker: We're bosom buddies. We're like Tom Hanks and that other guy nobody remembers, but without the cross-dressing. / Fooker: Ya know, Fred tries to act all gruff and sarcastic, but deep down he's as soft and squishy as his cytoplasm. While I'm sure Ol' Needlenose may have ruffled his feathers, I don't buy Fred libeling him. That's not in his nature. / Nicole: Thank you, Mr. Barker. / Fooker: Now digesting a guy's remote control to keep him from changing the channel, THAT he'll do. / {{Reference to GPF comic strip: Jan. 2, 1999}} http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050801.html

Dwayne: In business, Fred has been nothing but professional. We had a couple rough anti-social spots at first, but he grew out of them. Although he was partly at fault in his disagreements with Trent, Trent was clearly the aggressor. / Nick: He's always been helpful to those that really know him. His quirky sense of humor should not be confused with malice. His sarcasm rarely is laced with real spite and venom. / Ki: Fred has filled a valuable place in our lives. He's not only an interesting personality, but also a good friend. He helped me in a very difficult situation once, and I've always appreciated that. / Mercedes: Your Honor, the Defense is wasting the court's time with this nonsense. / Nicole: On the contrary, I am establishing the defendant's character. / Judge: Overruled, but pick up the pace a bit, counsel. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050802.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050803.html
Nicole: Mr. Physarum, the plaintiff stated that he pulled a few "pranks" on you in October 2003. In your opinion, were these "harmless employee hazings?" / Fred: Absolutely not. / Fred: Would you consider it "harmless hazing" to put a bottle of arsenic in someone's lunch? Or a "practical joke" to squirt them with concentrated acid from a water gun? I wouldn't, yet that's equivalent tot what he did to me. / Fred: Bleach and disinfectants are lethal to me. I felt genuinely threatened by his "pranks". Yet he laughed it off like a drunken Frat boy. / Nicole: Did you retaliate against him when you felt your life was threatened? / Fred: No. / Nicole: Then what DID you do? / Fred: I followed the procedure in the Employee Handbook. I filed a complaint with Mr. Duncan which he promptly addressed. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050803.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050804.html
Nicole: So you went through proper channels to resolve this situation, even though you felt your life was threatened. Yet the plaintiff attests you resorted to illegal means to resolve a petty argument. / Nicole: Somehow, that doesn't make sense to me. But perhaps the plaintiff himself could explain it better. I call Trenton N. Terrell to the stand. / Trent: Hey, DLC! Any advice before I go up? / Mercedes: What? Oh, don't screw up. / Trent: Gee, THAT'S encouraging. / Mercedes: Stick to the plan and don't let her get you off course. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050804.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050805.html
Nicole: Mr. Terrell, what is your opinion of the defendant? / Trent: I'm not exactly going to let it rent my Summer condo at the beach, if you must know. / Nicole: Looking at the "pranks" you pulled--Lysol in a lunch bag, bleach in a water gun, a biohazard sign on the defendant's office door--one might think you consider him to be a hazard to your health. / Trent: Heck, yeah! That blob of-- / Trent: Er, I MEAN, Yes. That thing lives in a DUMPSTER. Who knows what filth it tracks into our office. / Nicole: Has the defendant ACTIVELY tried to "infect" you? / Trent: Well, it DID get its slime all over me when it took over my body. / Nicole: And because of this you became diseased? / Trent: I... had a... mild rash...? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050805.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050806.html
Nicole: Mr. Terrell, do you think the defendant is sentient? / Trent: I... really don't know... / Nicole: Do you think he is sapient, a thinking, rational being? / Trent: Well, er... / Judge: The plaintiff will answer the question. / Trent: Okay, look, so it SEEMS to think, at least a little, but it certainly isn't a match for any HUMAN. / Trent: It's a single-celled glob of goo! The only reason these others defend it is because it's their PET. They personify it like someone does a dog or cat. I wonder which one took the IQ test for it. / Nicole: Yet you undoubtedly consider HIM "human" enough to be sued. / Mercedes: OBJECTION! / Judge: Overruled. Obviously, the plaintiff and his counsel disagree. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050806.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050807.html
Nicole: Now, Mr. Terrell, let's look at exhibit A, the supposedly libelous blog entry in question, in more detail, shall we? / Nicole: Your counsel has kindly highlighted a number of passages in this text, identifying them as defamatory. However, I'm hard pressed to agree with her assessment. / Nicole: While I may agree one or two statements may APPEAR to be stated as fact when taken out of context, WITHIN context it appears obvious that these are the defendant's OPINIONS, wouldn't you agree? / Trent: Well, um... / Nicole: Mr. Terrell, please read the sentence before this one. In context, does it not make clear the next sentence is an opinion? / Trent: I... guess... / Nicole: And opinions, by the definition of libel, are NOT defamatory. The defendant is free to think whatever he wants about you, so long as he doesn't LIE. This clearly discounts ALL the highlighted statements except one. / Nicole: Admittedly, calling someone an attempted murderer is harsh. But tell, me, Mr. Terrell, what were YOU doing before you were hired by GPF software? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050807.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050808.html
Trent: I- I don't see how that could be relevant-- / Judge: Mr. Terrell, you will answer the question. / Nicole: What were you doing before you were hired by GPF? / Trent: I was... in prison. / Nicole: Why? / Trent: I was trying to frame Trudy Trueheart, an old... acquaintance of mine, with attempted murder. I wasn't trying to HIT Dwayne with that safe. Just SCARE him a little and make everyone think Trudy did it! / Nicole: What were you charged and CONVICTED of, Mr. Terrell? / Trent: Falsification of evidence. / Nicole: AND? / Trent: Attempted murder. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050808.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050809.html
Mercedes: YOU WHAT? / Judge: Counsel! You are not presenting arguments or cross-examining! Remain silent! / Mercedes: I OBJECT! / Judge: On what grounds? / Mercedes: The plaintiff did not share this information with me. / Judge: I'm afraid that isn't acceptable grounds for an objection. Overruled. Now take your seat, Counsel. Another outburst like that and I'll hold you in contempt. / Mercedes: Then I object on the grounds that the plaintiff is a complete idiot. / Judge: As much as I may agree, that's not sufficient grounds either. Overruled. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050809.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050810.html
Nicole: Mr. Terrell, you've already expressed that, unlike seemingly everyone else here today, you consider the defendant as sub-human. Yet your own counsel considers him a person to pursue this trial. / Nicole: Tell me, what did you think the results of your pranks would have been? If you had hit him with that bleach? / Trent: What NORMALLY happens to funky fungi hit by bleach. It gets destroyed. / Nicole: Yet several witnesses have testified to his intelligence, and we all consider him a person for the purpose of trial.

Jury foreman: We the Jury decide in favor of the defendant. His remarks were not libelous, as the plaintiff was indeed charged with attempted murder. / Judge: ORDER! We're not done yet! / Judge: Mr. Terrell, as the losing party, I am hereby issuing a restraining order forbidding you to have any further contact with the defendant. I'm also ordering a criminal investigation into your attempted murder. / Trent: B-but double jeopardy! / Judge: You were tried and convicted of ONE incident, but NOT the attempts on the defendant's life. / Judge: As for YOU, you committed fraud in order to obtain employment. Since you were undoubtedly... spawned in the United States, you aren't an illegal alien, but you are eligible for U.S. citizenship. / Judge: So I'm giving you 30 days to apply for valid citizenship rights.

If you want to try to become a GOOD writer, I suggest you practice ALL aspects of creation. / Ki: Instead of playing in someone else's universe, why don't you try creating your own?

Ya know, this character would work well on his own, and the situation in that file could work if I changed the Romulans to another alien race... / Dex thinks: It may start out as a patchwork quilt of fan fiction pieces, but I'll make it a tightly-woven tapestry of original Sci-Fi goodness! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050825.html

They just want to get their tentacles on that alien technology! / Ducan [Dwayne]: That may be true... / Ducan [Dwayne]: But so is the fact that this robot hacked OUR system, and through it, it hacked the Eelorians.

Dexlar [Dex]: I apologize for causing so many problems, Kyoko Kyoko Takahashi... / Kyoko [Ki]: It's okay, Dexlar, you didn't know what you were doing was "wrong". / Dexlar [Dex]: As you said, I was programmed to explore. My data probe was designed to be non-invasive, but with such unfamiliar systems, it may have been misinterpreted as an attack. / Dexlar [Dex]: However, I was unaware that your computer was so deeply interwoven with the Eelorians... / Kyoko [Ki]: It's not. We only have read-only links, except for communications. / Dexlar [Dex]: Then perhaps the Eelorians are in error. I did not "hack" any system. I merely explored data pathways. If their system was unidirectional, I would not have attempted to access it. / Kyoko [Ki]: Is that so... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050909.html

But here's the log that shows the transfer from our computer to theirs. / Kyoko [Ki] thinks: That shouldn't be possible. Heck, I'VE tried to hack their system, without luck. Their encryption matrix makes system-level access almost impossible from our side. Then how... / Kyoko [Ki] thinks: What's this? I don't recognize this file. It looks like some sort of low-level subroutine. How did it get here? And what does it do? If I can step through the raw code... / Kyoko [Ki] thinks: That's it!

Ducan [Dwayne]: I'm not happy about this, T'rel. I'm not convinced the robot meant any sort of malice against your computer. / Trentoc [Trent]: You humans are far too trusting. But the treaty is clear, and our courts will decide the robot's fate. / Ducan [Dwayne]: If you could give us a little more time to conduct a thorough investigation... / Trentoc [Trent]: I've had enough of your stalling, General! Release the machine to us now or-- / [[Kyoko [Ki] enters]] / Kyoko [Ki]: Hold everything! / Trentoc [Trent]: What is the meaning of this interruption? General, discipline your subordinate! / Kyoko [Ki]: Discipline yourself, T'rel. I'm on to your little scheme. / Kyoko [Ki]: General, I have here a series of data logs that not only prove that Dexlar did NOT hack the Eelorian system, but that this was part of the Magistrate's elaborate plan to seize Dexlar's alien technology for himself. / Trentoc [Trent]: How DARE you accuise me of such subterfuge, Chief! I am appalled at the speed with which you fabricated this "evidence!" / Kyoko [Ki]: Nothing was fabricated, Magistrate. Your own computer can verify it. / Ducan [Dwayne]: At any rate, it appears Chief Takahashi has provided us with something to investigate. I'm sure this confiscation can wait until we review her "evidence". http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050911.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050912.html
Kyoko [Ki]: Magistrate T'rel claims Dexlar's data probe gained system-level access to the Eelorian computers after compromising our own. This shouldn't be possible, as we only have read-only access to their knowledge base. / Kyoko [Ki]: Yet both our and their logs clearly show a system-level login at the very moment Dexlar was probing our system. / Trentoc [Trent]: Ha! You only prove my point! / Kyoko [Ki]: On the contrary, Dex was scanning our engineering database at the time of the Eelorian intrusion. There's no direct interface between that database and the Eelorian computer. We keep it separate for our OWN security. / Kyoko [Ki]: But Dex's sweep DID trigger a small piece of embedded code, deep in our system, that has been laying dormant for several years. I find it interesting that its timestamp corresponds with our first Eelorian computer link up. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050912.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050913.html
Ned [Nick]: You're implying the Eelorians implanted a backdoor into our computer when they first established the link with us? / Trentoc [Trent]: Preposterous! / Kyoko [Ki]: Not implying; proving! I checked all system backups prior to and after the link, and it never existed before. The code executes a clever but harmless bypass of Eelorian security protocols. Enough to raise an alarm on cue. / Kyoko [Ki]: My suspicion is that they put this Trojan in our system as an ace in the hole, with no specific use in mind, but convenient in the off chance it might be needed. The magistrate knew of its existence, but I doubt few below his rank would. / Kyoko [Ki]: My guess is that he became frustrated by our legal salvage rights to the alien ship outside their space, and used the Trojan to simulate a hack when he learned of Dexlar's probe. Then he could cry foul and seize Dex and the ship. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050913.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050914.html
Trentoc [Trent]: This is ludicrous! I demand that we end this charade and that you hand over the robot immediately! / Ducan [Dwayne]: I don't think so. Kyoko's evidence seems valid to me. / Ducan [Dwayne]: With no real intrusion by Dexlar into your computer, your criminal extradition claim has no merit. Thus, OUR salvage claim still holds, as enforced by the very treaty you religiously cling to, T'rel. / Trentoc [Trent]: My government will not stand for this treachery! / Ned [Nick]: On the contrary, I suspect they'll be so embarrassed by your mishandling of this that they'll backpedal quicker than a Rigellian razorback. / Ducan [Dwayne]: It wouldn't surprise me if they relieved you of your post, Magistrate. / Trentoc [Trent]: Laugh while you can, General.

Dexlar [Dex]: I apologize for causing you and your superiors so many problems, Kyoko. / Kyoko [Ki]: I'm sorry you got caught up in our politics, Dex. / Kyoko [Ki]: Your vessel has been repaired as best as I can do it. But without a power core, you won't get far, and we can't exactly harness a black hole for you. / Dexlar [Dex]: The voyage home would be long and... lonely. My creators most likely already assumed our ship was lost. Besides, I was sent to meet and observe new cultures that I encounter... / Dexlar [Dex]: I suspect there is much here I can yet observe... / Kyoko [Ki]: You're welcome to stay, Dexlar. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050915.html

[[Ki finishes reading Dex's story, "Prometheus One".]] / Dex: Well? What did you think? Is it okay? / Ki: I think it's pretty good, Dex. / Ki: The plot works, although you could have foreshadowed the twist better. Maybe add a little to the pre-Dexlar bit to build tension. The descriptions are pretty vivid. / Ki: You can tell that the characters are well developed in your head. It will be interesting to see what you can do with them when you write more about them. / Dex: So... you think I should write more? / Ki: Part of me wonders if encouraging you is a good thing, but yes. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050916.html

Sharon: Wow... I- I don't know what to say... / Alice: I know you've always wanted to know about your birth parents. But for some reason these records were difficult to find. / Alice: First we were told there were none. Then we found they were sealed. It's taken years to finally get them, but here they are! / Sharon: Oh, thank you, Mom! / Sharon: As much as I love you two, I've always wanted to learn about my real parents, to find out who they were and what they were like. Maybe even learn why they put me up for adoption... / Fooker: Maybe that "birthmark" is a branding form a secret government genetics lab... / Sharon: Maybe SOMEone isn't getting any genetic experiments later tonight... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050520.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050521.html
Ki: Wow! This is a big moment for you, Sharon! Maybe we should leave you and your parents while you-- / Sharon: Are you kidding? I'd love to have you guys here! / Sharon: Let's see... There's no info on my biological father. Oh, well. But here's my Mom's name! It's... It's... / [[silence as they concentrate intently on the page]] / Sharon: How DO you pronounce that?! / Nick: Don't dislocate your tongue... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050521.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050522.html
Ki: Hey, Sharon! Thakns again for having us all over last night! / Sharon: Hm? Oh, no problem, Ki. / Ki: How did things go with your parents and Fooker after Nick and I left? / Sharon: They were only joking, but it WAS funny watching a former super spy sweat meeting his girlfriend's parents. / Ki: What's this? Doing research on your biological Mom? / Sharon: Well, trying to. I'm not being very successful. / Sharon: "Esther Matusevitch" doesn't SEEM like a very common name, but I figured at least SOMETHING would turn up. So far, I just keep hitting dead end after dead end. / Ki: Maybe it was your Mom's maiden name, or she used a false name. / Sharon: Could be. Since there's no mention of my Dad's name, anything is possible. / Ki: Heh, one hopes she's not a convicted felon! Hey! A result just popped up! Where are you now? / Sharon: The FBI's known fugitives page... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050522.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050523.html
Ki: Oh, Sharon! I didn't mean anything by that "convicted felon" crack... / Sharon: I know... I'm just shocked my Mom's name showed up in the FBI's database. / Ki: Does it say what she's accused of? / Sharon: I'm not sure. The public records don't seem very exhaustive. / Sharon: However, "Esther Matusevitch" looks like only one of many aliases this woman has used over the years. There's got to be twenty or more "AKA's" in this list. / Ki: It looks like your search just took an exponential leap in complexity... / Sharon: Assuming I'm even on the right path to begin with... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050523.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050524.html
Sharon: No lunch with Nick? / Ki: He's having a lunch meeting with a client. How goes the Mom search? / Sharon: Well, using publicly available records, I managed to link a number of those aliases to a pattern of movement that does put "Esther" in the right city when I was born. / Sharon: I also managed to dig deeper at the FBI to show that she's been in the money laundering business for decades. And she's good at it: usually, when the Feds crack one scheme, she's already two steps ahead of them. / Ki: So NOW what are you going to do? / Sharon: Pull a few favors from my hacker friends, do some cracking myself, and solve this mystery once and for all. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050524.html

[[Sharon typing at computer]] / Computer: smurphy, herez those files u wanted me to cr@ck. what r they 4? / Sharon types: genealogy experiment. thanks, neo. / Sharon thinks: Hm... Looks like I was right. Whether or not she really IS my Mom, "Esther" has been one busy lady. If the FBI could legally subpoena these records, they'd have a field day. / Sharon thinks: However, cross-referencing all these sources, I DO see a few common threads. She's thorough at covering her tracks, but she seems to always link back to a Diederich Pharmaceuticals, even though the FBI dismissed that link. / Sharon on the phone: Hello, Dwayne? Sorry about the late notice, but I need to take a personal day tomorrow. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050525.html

However, I do have some very important-- / receptionist: Ms. Diederich is a very busy woman, Ma'am.

[[Anna's first appearance]] / [[Sharon is speaking with someone who Sharon thinks is Elsbeth. It is later revealed that Anna, who works for Elsbeth, is pretending to be Elsbeth.]] / "Elsbeth" [Anna]: Good morning. How may I help you, Miss...? / Sharon: Sharon Murphy. I'm looking for Elsbeth Diederich. / "Elsbeth" [Anna]: I am she. / "Elsbeth" [Anna]: Is something wrong, Miss Murphy? / Sharon: Er... No. I just expected someone much... older. / "Elsbeth" [Anna]: I became CEO of this company after my father passed away. / Sharon: I see. I have only one question: does the name Esther Matusevitch mean anything to you? / "Elsbeth" [Anna]: I'm afraid not. Should it? / Sharon: I suppose not. Apparently, I followed a wrong lead. Sorry to waste your time. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050527.html

[[Sharon has left, and a shadow, apparently Esther Diederich/Matusevitch, is speaking with Anna]] / Esther: Excellent job, Anna. / Anna: Was that deception really necessary, Ms. Diederich... I mean, Ma'am? Was it really... HER? / Esther: Yes, Anna. It's her. And if she tracked me here even when the Feds gave up, she's smarter than I ever hoped. / Anna: Intelligence has alwlays been a trait in the women of your family. / Esther: Her father may have PLAYED dumb, but he was smarter than he looked. That rat... / Anna: What's the next step? If she found YOU, she could find-- / Esther: If they find each other, we'll deal with the consequences.

I'm back. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050529.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050530.html
Welcome back Fooker! It's great to have you back at GPF. / It's great to be back, Chief. / I'm sorry it took so long. Our expansion was on track before a certain incident nearly jeopardized signing the contract. / What, "Wiley Wombat?" I told you what happened. / Anyway, that's all cleared up and we're back on schedule. I'm going to need the best sys admin around to keep things humming. / Good thing we've got the two best admins now. / So what's your first official act as the new lead sys admin? / Get me some strong black coffee. I've got some kernels to patch... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050530.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050531.html
Okay gang, let me explain how the new work is going to progress... / In addition to her current space, were now renting the fourth floor. Sharon and Fooker will be setting up the network there over the next week. Fooker will then admin the new work while Sharon gets the pre-existing stuff. / I'm making Nick team lead for the newest project. Ki will take his place on our existing work, and Dexter will become Junior DBA to help offset Ki's new responsibilities. / Kewl! A promotion! / This is starting to sound like the original "Trek" movies. We're all commanders, captains and admirals with no ensigns to man the ship. / I'm getting to that. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050531.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050601.html
To get things rolling, I'm hiring three new contractors. Like Dex when he started, they're right-to-hire, so I plan to bring them on full-time if they work out fine. / Luckily for us, regional telecoms just ended their infrastructure upgrade, so we can bring on people Fooker already knows. That will help ease them into our group. / The other two will arrive this afternoon. But I'll go ahead and introduce you to -- / Patty! / Oookay... maybe you guys have already met... / I am SO having fondue flashbacks right now... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050601.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050602.html
I haven't assigned Patty to a team yet, but I'll handle that by tomorrow. Why don't want a few show her around why handle some paperwork? Dex, you seem to know Patty. Can you give her the grand tour? Dex? / C'mon, Patty. He'll be locked in that race condition for a few hours. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050602.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050603.html
And this is the kitchen and break room. I think your office will be upstairs. Any questions? / Let's see... Ki, isn't it? About Dexter... he's not going to go all creepy stalker mode on me just because of one blind date, is he? / No, I think yet grew that a few years ago... I hope. You're not going to have a problem working with HIM, are you? / Not as long as he remembers what I told him at Fondue For You. There aren't any other cosmic coincidences that I need to watch out for, right? Dwayne's not hiring that Trish chick, is he? / God, I hope and pray not... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050603.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050604.html
It's time for us to head out to GPF software. / I know. Just gathering a few last-minute things... / Are you sure this is wise? Will be working right among them. We can't hide our surveillance there. / It can't be helped. We MUST know the answer. / Barker didn't recognize us, but Murphy might. If she puts two and two together... / It's been almost 2 years. Time may be on our side. Come, Brother Timothy. Today, we fulfill the destiny of the brotherhood, and find out if Murphy truly is THE ONE... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050604.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050605.html
Shar, can you give me more slack? You're not letting me clear this support beam. / Sorry. Next time Dwayne wants us to pull cable, tell him to pick a day when I'm not wearing a skirt. I'm not crawling around in that floor until I put on some jeans. I HAVE my modesty... / Hey, Ms. Modest. Is that a thong, or are you just not --? OW! / Excuse me. Are we interrupting something? / Yeah, just domestic violence. Sharon, this is Tim and Scott. They worked with me at Regional. / Hello. / Aren't these the two "stalkers" you told us about? / Yeah, but they're cool. They haven't followed me around for a while. They're mostly harmless. / You... look awfully familiar somehow... / It's the goatee. Everyone is wearing them these days. / Amen, beard brother. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050605.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050606.html
You're just in time to help us pull some cable. After we're done, we'll take you downstairs and get you acquainted with everyone else. Since Sharon and I already know the new floor plan, will split up and take one of you each. The four of us should get most of this done in a couple hours. Tim, go with Sharon. Scott, you're with me. / This is your chance. Don't forget the tests of the prophecy. / Say, I could go for some coffee before we get started... / Hm... I guess it wouldn't hurt if we hurry... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050606.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050607.html
So you actually CHEW some coffee beans first, THEN wash them down with the brew? / It's an acquired taste. / I guess she passes the caffeine test... / While I've got a strong man with me, why don't you help me move some hardware upstairs? / Some of this equipment looks pretty old. / We keep some of these old machines around for clients with small requirements. Not everyone needs top-of-the-line hardware. / Betcha can't make a ten teraflop supercomputer out of this pile of junk... / The woman in me wonders why you'd make that challenge, but the geek in me says you're on. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050607.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050608.html
... Then it's just a matter of installing the right kernel to handle the distributed processing load. Got it? / I... think so. / Come on. Fooker and Scott are way ahead of us by now... / She can actually BUILD it, but it WAS rather inventive design... Now to get the other brothers to initiate the third test... / I'll get the doors if you'll push the cart. The elevator is just outside... / Sharon! Someone just sent Trent a virus and it's crippling our network! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050608.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050609.html
Good grief, Trent! How many times do I have to tell you not to open spam anymore? / Just wait until I get my complementary flatscreen TV and PSP... / This thing is voracious! It's spreading like mad, clogging the LAN. Fortunately, most of the machines have the latest security patches, so infections are at a minimum. I'll just take your machine off the LAN until I can do a full scan and clean on it. / And how am I supposed to WORK then? / Do what you do 95% of the time: use your PHONE. Sorry, Tim. This takes priority. But it should only take a few minutes... / Mind if I... observe? / Not at all. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050609.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050610.html
She's totally absorbed in her task, at one with the machine! And THAT looks like my next checklist item... I've never seen an editor like that... / What? Oh, sorry. I was deep in thought. This old thing, I wrote on a whim. I was never one for the whole of the VI/Emacs war. I never found an editor that did everything I wanted, so I wrote my own. And THERE, we're done! / She's passed every test... but one... / Now let's get back to... hello? What's this? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050610.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050611.html
It's some sort of the encrypted message... / Really? Where did it come from? / Knowing my luck, it's another virus. While I'm curious, I'll leave that nugget to investigate later. We've got cable to run. You coming, Tim? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050611.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050612.html
Scott: Hurry! Barker and Murphy went back downstairs for supplies. Did you administer the tests? / Tim: Well, yes... / Scott: And? And? / Tim: Er... You remember how Barker didn't exactly fail, but we couldn't say he passed either...? / Scott: Gah! / Patty: Gee, Scott. I didn't know you were a masochist... / Scott: Grr... How can this be? Only Barker and Murphy bear the skills to be The One! How could they both fail the tests? / Patty: Back on that "The One" train? / Tim: Could "thePR0PH3T" have been wrong about the tests? He did say the prophecy was buried deep in the usenet archives, much like the "Bible Code"... / Scott: He checked it thrice, and I verified it. / Tim: Then perhaps neither of them is The One! There was no time frame set in the prophecy... / Scott: No! I cannot be wrong! I know The One shall be found! / Patty: Um, guys? / Scott: I will not rest until I have proven either Barker or Murphy is-- / Sharon: Is what? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050612.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050613.html
Scott: Gah! / Sharon: Just what is going on here? / Sharon: There's something fishy about you two. I've had a weird vibe ever since you showed up. / Fooker: Besides, maniacal ranting is usually confined to non-business hours. / Sharon: I know I've seen you two before! But for some reason I can't place you, like you're from a distant past... / Fooker: Ever been to Nerdvana? Or the sci-fi con in Springfield? / Sharon: That's it! You're with the Brotherhood of the Twisted Pair! / Fooker: They are? I could have sworn they were from Code-a-holics Anonymous... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050613.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050614.html
Sharon: Now I recognize you! Scott was the one they called "Zero One," and Tim was "One Zero." You both were there when I was "interrogated." / Fooker: Yeah... Now I remember Scott being there. I don't remember you though... / Tim: I-I was a newb when you were initiated. Another was One Zero before me. / Scott: We beg your forgiveness, my lady! Our treatment of both of you in the past was wrong, and if you'll let me explain, I will reveal all to you. / Sharon: Whatever. Just get back up. / Scott: I am not worthy to be in your presence... / Sharon: No, get up. I've already had one dork looking up my skirt today... / Fooker: Hey! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050614.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050615.html
Scott: After the raid, the Brotherhood was fractured, with most following Greg, the "One One," but a few remained loyal to me. We have remained underground ever since. / Scott: Both fragments have been diligently seeking "The One," an uber hacker who will revolutionize the online world. The prophecy was discovered during a complex analysis of usenet's archives. / Scott: They believe we have been too radical in the search, looking for candidates that they would quickly dismiss. But we think we have found The One, or at least two of the most promising prospects. / Sharon: And who would that be? / Patty: This would be the point where meaningful glances are exchanged, revelations are dawned, and I get to say, "Well, Duh," right? Just checking... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050615.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050616.html
Sharon: You seriously think one of the two of us is this "The One" you've been searching for? / Scott: You both possess the skills set forth by the prophecy. / Scott: We have quietly tested you each, Jason at Regional Telecom and Sharon today. But alas, I'm afraid our tests were... inconclusive. / Sharon: What do you mean? / Tim: "thePR0PH3T" found a series of tests to administer to candidates for "The One." While you each passed most of them, the last you didn't exactly match. / Sharon: Then I guess your tests are over. / Fooker: Not necessarily. What if, while analyzing usenet, this guy had a bug in his code? / Sharon: Fooker! / Fooker: Just trying to be helpful... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050616.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050617.html
Scott: His calculations were verified by many others, including myself, but I suppose there could have been something we overlooked... / Fooker: Let's take a look at it then... / Sharon: Hold on a sec! Are you seriously planning on helping them? This is the Brotherhood we're talking about! You're "He Who Shall Not Be Named," remember? / Fooker: I know, I know... But I originally wanted to join these guys Fred--er, I slipped up. Besides, now I'm curious about this whole prophecy thing. This could be fun. / Sharon: And what exactly is your role in all this? / Patty: If you find out, I'd like to be the first to know... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050617.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050618.html
Scott: I contacted "thePR0PH3T" and he is e-mailing you the code now. He says it is an honor to have you debug it for us. / Fooker: Here it is. / Fooker: Whew... this is pretty complex stuff... / Scott: Yes, it is. It must process all of the usenet archive, not just a portion, and in the original ASCII, not unicode. / Fooker: Well, he gets brownie points for obfuscated C code. Here's the problem: He's got a "count++" when he ought to use "++count". Right, Sharon? / Sharon: Yeah. All his counts are off by one. / Sharon: Heh... maybe that's the "one" you should be looking for... / Patty: That settles it. I officially like these two... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050618.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050619.html
Fooker: There. I've tweaked the code and added a few optimizations. Now we just wait for the results... / Scott: That could take a while. That's some very intense computations on a very large volume of data. / Fooker: No sweat. I hacked SETI@Home a while back, so I just uploaded the code and data to their network. Now all those distributed machines are doing our work, at least for a little while... / Scott: If you are not The One, I will still be humbled by your presence... / Sharon: Well, while we're waiting, maybe you can explain something. If this process looks at all of usenet, what about recent posts? Won't those change the results? / Scott: Not necessarily, but I understand your reasoning. Our experiences, however, show that new posts only serve to clarify the results, just as more data in a high resolution image yields a sharper picture. / Scott: Perhaps the analogy to the "Bible Code" was not entirely accurate, as the Bible is a static document while usenet is always evolving... / Patty: Here's one, since we're playing twenty questions... / Patty: What's stopping Fooker and Sharon from rigging the code so they'll be a perfect match on your tests? / Sharon: Since neither of us wants to be "The One", I'd be more concerned about the opposite... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050619.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050620.html
Fooker: And it's done! Let me clean up SETI@Home to hide our intrusion, then we'll look at the results. / Scott: Huzzah! / Tim: So far, the text doesn't look very different. Every thing seems to be here... all six questions are there... / Scott: Six questions? There were only five before! / Tim: Here it is, Scott! The last test, the one they both failed! It seems it wasn't really one test, but two! We ran the words together. / Scott: So... that means instead of "insatiably curious," it should really be...? / Patty: I've got a funny feeling I don't want to hear the end of that sentence... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050620.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050621.html
Sharon: "Insatiable" and "curious"? What the heck does that mean? / Scott: Well, let's think about it for a moment. First on "curious..." / Scott: You both went back and looked at the unknown file we sent you, after first walking away from it. We *thought* you failed, but because an *insatiably* curious person would drop everything to find the answer. / Scott: But since you *did* look at it eventually, then you *are* curious, and you pass that test! This is getting better! / Patty: Then exactly how are they both "insatiable"? / [[Sharon and Fooker both turn away from the Brotherhood, Sharon blushing and Fooker whistling]] http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050621.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050622.html
Scott: Quickly! Tell us, how frequently do you... um... you know... / Fooker: At least three times a-- / Sharon: NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. / Patty: Maybe you should look at it a different way. *They* are a geek couple who can theoretically do it any time they want. When was the last time anyone in the *Brotherhood* saw any action? / [[Scott and Tim stare at each other as Patty looks on]] / [[Scott and Tim turn away from each other, blushing furiously]] / Patty: That's what I thought. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050622.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050623.html
Tim: So... it appears both Sharon and Fooker have passed all the tests to be "The One!" / Sharon: That's a matter of interpretation... / Patty: But can that be? They can't both be "The One". The semantics don't quite work out... / Fooker: Ask Zathras... / Scott: Wait a minute... / Scott: Perhaps it is neither of them who is "The One". Perhaps these tests do not identify "The One", but those who precede "The One", who must come first to herald his ultimate coming! / Sharon: I don't like where this is going... / Scott: Quickly! Search their desks for condoms and destroy them! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050623.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050624.html
Ki: So what's it like being the future mother of the geek messiah? / Sharon: Oh, God... Don't tell me you've heard already... / Ki: It's kind of hard not to, with those new guys following around all the time... / Sharon: Fooker and I haven't had any peace in three days. / Sharon: You know, I don't care what they believe. They can think I'm the queen of Egypt for all I care. But the constant questions... "Are you pregnant?" "You aren't on the pill, are you?" / Sharon: But the webcam in my bedroom is just going too far! / Scott: But I wanted to capture the moment of conception! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050624.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050625.html
Patty: Hey, Tim. You've been quiet the last few days. I figured you'd be as excited as Scott about finding the secret of "The One". / Tim: So did I... / Tim: But I think I'm getting a disenchanted with the whole thing.

I thought I heard a woman's voice in the background over the phone... / Dexter: Must have been the, um, TV. Yeah... / [[The group is walking down the hall towards Nick's apartment.]] / Fooker: Well, even though the molds moved back in with me, Nick's had Fred over here every night this week, and he's not happy about it. / Sharon: I wonder what's up. / Fooker: I don't know, but I'm starting to get that weird vibe I always get every time I go to see Prof. Wisebottom. / Dexter: What's what? / [[The group, looking into Nick's apartment, are all startled.]] / Fooker: It smells of mad science. / [[Nick and Ki are dressed in matching super-hero style costumes, his with matching gold glasses, hers with tiara and a bare midriff.

What's this "MUTEX?" / Sharon: Nick's virtual reality machine. / Nick: Not anymore! Now it's an interdimensional transporter! / Fooker [[sardonically]]: Ah, makes perfect sense. A logical next step. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050404.html

Nick: You see, during the time you were off playing spy, I built a virtual reality engine called the MUTEX. Sharon and Dex may remember that. / Nick: Later, when I hooked it up to the Velociraptor power supply, it acted strangely, as if it transported Ki and me into an alternate reality. Then I found out it really DID. / Nick: Since then, I've been observing other dimensions and making modifications, perfecting the reality matrix until I'm now positive that interdimensional travel is not only REAL but can even be SAFE. / Nick: Would you believe I found an Earth where the Statue of Liberty is only 151 feet tall? There's no way all those C.R.U.D.E. and UGA fighters could fit into THAT statue! Heh... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050405.html

[[Dexter, Fooker, Sharon, and Nick are all in Nick's apartment.]] / Dexter: So where exactly do *we* fit into all this? / Nick: Well, I've reached a point where it needs a serious test, and I thought I'd share it with my friends. / Sharon: After what happened the last time, you'll forgive *me* if I'm a little leery. / Nick: Don't worry. The MUTEX is completely self-contained now, so it can't be hacked. It's completely safe. / Nick[[typing at the terminal, as Fred the slime mold looks on]]: In fact, I can even create a pocket universe, separate and with a closed set of parameters. That should limit the number of things that could potentially go wrong. / Fooker: *Create* a *universe*?

These outfits should be acceptable. / Nick: As usual, Fred has control here, and now I have a device so I can access the console from anywhere. So either way, we should have an instant escape route home. / [[Nick holds the device, as Fred the slime mold looks on.]] / [[Nick hands a MUTEX helmet to Sharon.

It's Todd *and* his father! / Gamester: Both? Their timing is impeccable. / Mischief: Todd's on that assignment you sent him on, but he's in danger! And Nick's firing up his multiplex thingy! / Gamester: Todd is on his own, I'm afraid. The MUTEX must come first. / Flea: Hey! You pull me here out of my time stream and now yer gonna *ignore* me?

Sharon: Why do we look so different? / Nick: The MUTEX "adapts" our appearance to the target universe if it varies from our own universe. That's why we appeared as "furries" on our last trip. / Ki[[feeling Nick's huge biceps]]: And I suppose that explains your, um, *heroic* proportions? / Nick: Heh, well, I *did* tweak the settings just a little... / Dexter: No fair! I want to be tweaked! / Fooker[[grinning]]: Oh, *now* I get it! We're in a universe based on your comic book guy "Absolutely Incredible Man!" / Sharon: Absolutely Incrediwho what? / Ki: Fooker! He doesn't know we know that! / Nick: It's okay, Ki. I already knew you guys found my superhero comic years ago. I just didn't want you to know I saw you. I thought this would be a good test bed for the MUTEX's abilities. / Sharon: So Nick draws comic books. Why doesn't that surprise me? / Nick: I don't get to draw much now, thanks to the Inventor's Gene.

But we're currently in our "secret identities," so we can't go "super" in a public park. / Dexter, excitedly: *Super heroes*?! I can overlook the fourth finger for *that*! Quick! What are my powers! / Nick: I... don't know yet. Fooker, Ki, and I each had an analogous character, as did Dwayne and Trudy, but I stopped A.I.M. before you and Sharon joined GPF Software. / Dexter: But you knew me *before* then. I'm sure you came up with *something* kewl for me back then... / Nick, embarrassed: Well, I *did* have something in mind. But... er, maybe we should discuss this somewhere more private... / [[Dexter, Ki, and Nick begin to walk away]] / Dexter: Awesome! Do we have an uberspiffy group transport? Secret communicators? Are we going to our hidden lair? Is it in space? Or maybe it's in the center of the earth...? / Fooker, privately to Sharon: I'm sure glad I'm the only ex-spy around here... / Sharon: I think Dex's head would explode if *he* were James Baud instead of you. / Dexter: What about toys? Do we have action figures made after us? A Saturday morning cartoon? I hope and pray there's a lunchbox, and it better be "retro" metal and not plastic... / [[As the five walk away into the background, in the foreground, appearing through the very fabric of reality, is the man-sized flea wearing a super suit, last seen in the April 9, 2005 strip.]] http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050412.html

I'll have the computer fashion new ones for Dex and Sharon once we finalize your powers. / Fooker, looking at his costume bracelet: So how do these doodads work? / Nick: Tap the logo once and it'll act as a communicator.

No Spandex for my costume, please... / Nick: Um, I'll see what I can do.

Your computer says otherwise! / [[Dexter points to a drawing in the background, depicting a man of his proportions, wearing body armor and carrying some kind of spear.]] / Dexter: YOU MADE ME A VILLIAN! / Nick: I stopped drawing it years ago! We weren't friends back then! / Dexter: It's bad enough Ki's fantasy book had me as a stupid troll, and now *this*? You guys sure had a high opinion of me... / Ki: Relax, Dexter... Sure, we had some rough spots in the past, but we've all grown since then, especially you. Don't hold it against Nick if his *old* opinions weren't flattering. / [[Dexter is still angry, with a dark cloud over his head.]] / Nick: Besides... / Nick: Now you can be the repentant villian turned hero! Saved from the ways of evil, but still haunted by his dark side... Anti-heroes *always* make the kewlest characters... / Dexter, brightening: You're... right! / Sharon: Well, that leaves us with two questions. First, who am I and what do I do? / Nick: I don't know. I think the MUTEX will extrapolate a character design based on my artwork. / Nick: And the second question? / Sharon: What's that flashy thingy? / [[Fooker peers at a large red button flashing on a console.]] / Fooker: It's red and buzzing, so my guess is nothing good. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050414.html

That means the city is in peril! / Fooker: Gee, that sounds like a job of a bunch of super heroes! / Nick: The computer can't identify the threat, but places it in the city park. / Ki: Where we first arrived? That's odd. Well, what's next? / Nick: Dex, Sharon, and I still need to change. Then we'll fly over there and check it out.

But the probability of that occurring is astronomical. / Mischief: Says the entity who deals with astronomical probabilities all the time... / Gamester: Touche. / Gamester: Nevertheless, our presense here is only temporary. We must find just where the Speck went before he encounters the other interlopers into this universe. / Mischief: We're not allowed to directly interfere...

Everyone else, let 'im have it! / Dexter: Hey, um, Speck! Why don't you use your super speed on him, like loosening a few bolts really fast? / The Inexplicable Speck!: Because my powers don't work that way. My super speed gave out during Nick's apology speech. / Dexter: Gave out? / The Inexplicable Speck!: My powers are tied to the unstable half-life of a new type of radiation I discovered. / The Inexplicable Speck!: Thus, when the half-life expires, my powers change. The super speed *may* come back eventually, but until I discover the new power, I don't know what it is. / Dexter: Wow... That's... *weird.* / The Inexplicable Speck!: Tell me about it.

If you "created" this guy and you know his weaknesses, now would be a good time to share them! / Nick: Ordinarily, the Warmonger is just a guy in a big metal battle suit. The Team could easily defeat him on even terms. / Nick: But as long as he has the Mobius Wave Gem, we *can't* defeat him. That's why he stole it! / Nick: The Mobius Wave was created by an ancient alien race called the Elorinians. With their advanced technology, they created a new perpetual energy source to replace their dying sun. Like a Mobius Strip, the Wave is endless with no beginning or end. Some say the Elorinians did not *create* the Wave, but they were the only ones to tap into it and harness its limitless power. / Nick: Ten thousand years ago, the evil sourcerer Deglok the Despicable sought to harness the Mobius Wave's power from any location. So he created a gem to focus time and space to the Wave's coordinates. The Absolutely Incredibles were pulled back in time to defeat Deglok, but when he was overpowered, he flung the Gem into an interdimensional void. The Team tried to -- / Someone else: HOLD ON A SEC! / The Inexplicable Speck!: Did we *really* need a history lesson? Wouldn't it have been easier just to say "Gem bad. Remove Gem.

I figured if I had these strange abilities, I might as well put them to good use. / The Inexplicable Speck!: I've met my share of bad seeds, and this world -- well, *my* world -- is screwed up enough as it is. If one person can make a difference, and that one person has to be *me,* then I'll do whatever I can to make things right. / The Inexplicable Speck!: It's bought me a lot of enemies, on *both* sides of the law.

I thought I *created* Absolutely Incredible Man; I hadn't even considered an alternate reality may exist where he and the others were really *real.* / Nick: Obviously, I'll have to check my notes when we get back.

Our appearances changed upon entering this world; would he change too? Would he become human? Would he shrink to the size of a normal flea? The variables are too numerous to even speculate. / The Inexplicable Speck!: Turning human...

But that doesn't amount to an open invitation to go universe hopping. / Gamester: Fortunately, neither you nor they caused any significant damage to _this_ universe. Your influence on _them_ could prove problematic in the future, however. / The Inexplicable Speck!: Next time, put a big "Do Not Enter" sign up with bold, red letters on it. / Gamester: With _your_ curiosity?

Hey, are you listening? / Fooker: Mm hm. / Sharon: I just heard that Microsoft is going to release the source code of Windows XP as open source. / Fooker: That's nice. / Sharon: And that's what I thought. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050124.html

Sharon: Fooker, what's up with you today? / Fooker: Sorry. I've been out in space. / Sharon: Obviously. You just passed a row of dirt-cheap motherboards without flinching. / Sharon: What has you so distracted? / Fooker: I dunno. I had this silly, crazy dream last night, and it got me thinking about... well, US. / Sharon: I'm beginning to LIKE this dream... / Fooker: Er, you might NOT. It didn't exactly paint you in the most flattering light. / Sharon: This isn't the one with me dressed up in plastic wrap while spanking Ed McMahon with a sausage while you're dancing "Swan Lake" in the nude again, is it? / Fooker: Fortunately, No. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050125.html

[[Sharon and Fooker are at a concessions stand in a bargain computer show]] / Sharon: So what was this dream about? / Fooker: That's not important. It's just random neurons firing in an unconscious mind. / Sharon: Ooh... that means it's a really bad one... / Fooker: No, no, it's... it's what it got me thinking about that's been bothering me, not the dream itself. / Fooker: I love you, Sharon, and there's no other woman I could see myself being with. But we've had this rocky on-again, off-again relationship, and now that we seem to be on for solid, I can't help wondering... / [[Sharon and Fooker sit with their food]] / Sharon: Are we heading for another break-up? / Fooker: Worse.

I mean, I am... but I didn't think you... / Fooker: Forget it. I shouldn't have brought it up. Let's just go and-- / Sharon: No, Fooker! Please! We obviously need to talk about this! We won't get anywhere if we don't share... / Fooker: But here?

But I thought you might. / Sharon: So... you don't want to marry me...? / Fooker: Gah, that's not what I meant. I love you, Sharon, and if I ever did want to marry someone, it would be you. I just don't want to get married, now or ever. / Fooker: I've had some... bad experiences with failed marriages, including my parents, and I don't want to follow in their footsteps. I just thought with Nick and Ki getting hitched, you might... you know... / Sharon: I promise I will do everything in my power to avoid catching the bouquet. / Fooker: Can we put you on the other side of the lawn?

I didn't think we had really been together long enough to even think about it yet. / Fooker: Whew. / Sharon: I've seen lots of successful marriages, including the Duncans. And I'm sure Nick and Ki will be the same. So I'm okay either way, and if at any time you change your mind, you can always ask me. / Sharon: But after what you've shared, I promise I'll never ask you. Nor will I pressure you into something you're not ready for. / Fooker: Even moving GPF to all Macs? / Sharon: Um, yeah. / Sharon: So, does that set your mind at ease? / Fooker: Yep. Big load off.

But I hope you will ultimately let me. / Akhilesh: However, if you do not wish to share your name, it would be much easier if we decide on something to call you.

But I'm not. / Trudy: Perhaps that is why I'm so confused about him. Have I been so manipulative and defensive that I've forgotten what blind trust even looks like?

I don't live next door. / Akhilesh: On the contrary! / Akhilesh: Everyone is my neighbor! We are neighbors on this earth, as we are all its citizens. We are told to "love your neighbor as yourself." / Trudy: Great. I'm being nursed to health by Mr. Rogers. / Akhilesh: Ha! Not quite, although I do like his choice of sweaters. / Akhilesh: Have you not heard the parable of the Good Samaritan? Even as his own countrymen passed him by, the poor victim was aided by a social outcast, who gave of his love for his fellow man and sought nothing in return. / Trudy: Perfect.

But you appear to me to be a lovely woman, if I may be so bold. Lovely, but so filled with pain and regret. You have such a heavy weight hanging about you... / Trudy: You don't know the half of it. / Akhilesh: I do not know what you have done in this life, nor is it my place to know. But I am a healer, and while I try to heal the body, I also try to heal the soul. Yours troubles me greatly. / Trudy: Well, don't trouble yourself.

I would not call God archaic. The Bible says He is "the same yesterday and today and forever." / Trudy: You know what I mean. How can you believe a god really exists? / Akhilesh: A better question would be how can I not? When I look at the intricacies of the human body, I cannot help but see His handiwork. I see not the random chance of millions of years of evolution, but the craftsmanship of the master artist. / Akhilesh: Besides, "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'" / Trudy: I have enough problems with jesters than to end up being one, thank you. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050222.html

Trudy: You... forgive me? / Akhilesh: It is not my place to judge a person by what they have done. That is between you and God. / Akhilesh: But I can see a change in you since you arrived. You see less of what ill the world has done to you and more of what you have done to it. That is the first step in finding forgiveness. / Akhilesh: I cannot heal your spirit, Trudy. I have done all that I can for your body, but that is all I can do. But I can point you in the right direction. / [[He offers her a copy of the Bible]] / Akhilesh: I feel you need to appeal to a higher power. Only then will you finally find peace. / {{Author's notes below the panel: "Some people may be confused by Akhilesh's reaction to Trudy's story. After all that we know she has done, how could anyone think to forgive her?

I expect you to find the answer to your *greatest* need: *forgiveness*. With all you have done, you may never find it from man, nor may you forgive yourself. But "if we confess our sins," God "is faithful and just and will forgive us." / Trudy: Like God would care about me, with all I've done... / Akhilesh: "He is patient with you, not wanting everyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance." / Trudy: What I've done is too terrible to forgive! / Akhilesh: "As far as East is from West, so far has He removed our transgressions from us." / Trudy: There's nothing I can do to atone for what I've done! / Akhilesh: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast." / Trudy: You are *beyond* irritating, do you know that? / Akhilesh: Perhaps, but I can keep this up all day if I must... / {{Author's notes below the comic: "Panel Two: 1 John 1:9.

How pleasant to see you this morning! / Nicole: Hello, Mercedes... / Mercedes: I noticed that our court date is coming up rapidly. Care to settle now and save yourself the embarrassment? / Nicole: No. / Mercedes: I'll warn you, our case is pretty devastating. Those server logs we subpoenaed speak volumes about your "client." / Nicole: I know. / Mercedes: You know what part of your problem is, Nicole? No ambition. You have to use all of your talents in the courtroom to get what you want. / Nicole: Like you, I suppose? / Nicole: I like how you won your last case by repeatedly crossing your legs in that short skirt, distracting the judge during the defense counsel's presentation. / Mercedes: I'd suggest you try it, but you need to jog a bit first... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050102.html

Fred: _Settle_?! After all the stuff Trent has pulled? No way! / Mrs. Duncan: Fred, I'm sorry. But I think it's for the best. / Mrs. Duncan: I know you picked me because I was the only lawyer you knew and you could trust, and I'm honored that you think of me that way, but I don't think I'm the right person to represent you. / Mrs. Duncan: Mercedes de la Croix is ruthless and unforgiving. She will ride this case into the ground. _You_ need a lawyer just as heartless and callous as her if you want to stand a chance of escaping intact. / Mrs. Duncan: I... can't stand up to her. She's sharpened steel, and I'm... softened butter. With _me_ on your side, you can only count on losing. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050107.html

Fred: What's with the sudden inferiority complex, Nicole? Did she make fun of you in front of everyone in the school cafeteria or something? / Nicole: Well... / Fred: You're right. I picked you because I knew you and trusted you. You're also the only chance I've got. Do you think anyone else in this law firm would even think of representing me? / [[Fred shrugs]] / Fred: I don't have any options. I only have you. But I'd pick you over any de la Croix any day. You understand me more than anyone outside of GPF could. / [[Nicole smiles at Fred]] / Fred: Much as I loathe using a sports metaphor, I'm up against the ropes, and I need my star goalie to score a touchdown in the bottom of the ninth. / Fooker: I don't get ESPN. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050108.html

Nicole: Okay, okay...maybe I'm a sucker for hopeless causes. But I STILL feel like a chihuahua defending a mouse from a tiger. / Fred: You remind me more of a pomeranian... / Nicole: Sigh...But that STILL doesn't solidify our defense. We have to clearly establish that your statements in these forum logs are NOT libelous defamatory remarks. / [[Nicole holds up a stack of forum transcriptions]] / Fred: Sounds simple enough. / Nicole: [[Looking over the transcriptions]] First of all, some of this is obviously hyperbole. I think it's safe to say it's physically impossible for Trent to... um, do what you said here. / Fred: Well, his nose IS pretty long. / Nicole: Second, most of this can easily be dismissed as opinion. Criticism, be it fair or not, is NOT defamation. / Fred: [[Reading from transcriptions]] Huh. I thought it was a well known FACT he buys hair gel by the tanker truck... / Nicole: But there are several statements you express as facts, and since this was a public blog, you can't claim absolute or qualified privilege. Can you prove these facts are true? / [[Nicole holds up the transcriptions for Fred to see]] / Fred: Absolutely. / Nicole: "'Brent' is a homicidal maniac, whose bloodlust is as insatiable as the appetite of his ego"? / [[Fred waves protoplasmic fists]] / Fred: HE TRIED TO BLEACH ME! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050109.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050110.html
Mrs. Duncan: Fred, I think we can easily dismiss all of these claims, with the exception of the claim of attempted murder. Surely _that's_ what Mercedes will focus on. / Mrs. Duncan: No matter how it's worded, that's stated as _fact_, not an opinion. And unless you can prove that it's _true_... / Fred: If I "accidentally" put rat poison in my boss' coffee, aren't I still guilty? / Mrs. Duncan: Maybe if you're Lily Tomlin, and not if you can steal the "body" first... / Fred: Curse TBS! Now I've got Dolly Parton stuck in my head... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050110.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050111.html
[[Nicole Duncans office, Nicole, Fred Physarum and Jason "Fooker" Barker is present]] / Nicole: Fred, I think you're missing my point. To prove this isn't libel, you have to prove the attempted murder claim is true. / Fred: No, I GOT that, and I SAID I can prove it. / Nicole: No, you're not. Murder is defined as the willful killing of a PERSON with malice aforethought. / Fred: EXACTLY. Trent knew PRECISELY that the bleach would kill me. / Nicole: Listen, Fred! It doesn't MATTER if Trent knew that or not. What the judge is going to ask is whether a SLIME MOLD, sentient or not, constitutes as a "person" by law! And what do you THINK he's going to say? / Fred: Oh. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050111.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050112.html
Fred: So it all comes back to my old "slime mold rights" campaign, doesn't it? / Nicole: Not quire. We can use this to our advantage / Nicole: If you're not a "person," then you have no legal identity and thus Trent's lawsuit is pointless. You can't be sued, the case gets dropped, and-- / Fred: Hold on a second! / Fred: You want me to give up my rights as a sentient being to end this on a technicality? And I suppose I should just happily give up my job, my bank account, my 401k, and all my other rights and possessions as well? / Nicole: Fred, our're blowing this out of propotion. / Fred: Then I suppose "separate but equal" wasn't "out of propotion" either. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050112.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050113.html
Fooker: Ouch, Fred. Um, that was pretty low... / Mrs. Duncan: But he still made his point. / Mrs. Duncan: Okay. We have to prove you're a "person" with all the rights associated with that label. Luckily, Mercedes _must_ agree with that assessment, or the entire basis of Trent's lawsuit is moot. / Mrs. Duncan: But _please_ realize that this opens you up to a whole new level of scrutiny. No more hiding. No more sanctuary among friends. You and Persephone will be exposed to the world, and we won't be able to protect you. / Fred: You know, I've thought about that a lot, Nicole. And although Trent is the one flushing us out, we might as well come out boldly and steal away his thunder. / Fred: Let's do it. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050113.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050114.html
[[Nicole Duncans office, Nicole, Fred and Fooker are present]] / Nicole: Then our plan is clear. We have two objectives: To prove a slime mold is legally a person, and to prove your murder claim is true. / Nicole: We'll need all the evidence you can find for the latter. The water gun, the bleach, eye witnesses... / Fred: I can get them all. Trent hasn't tried to hide anything. / Nicole: The former, though, will be difficult. We'll have to PROVE your sentience. / Fred: No problem. Ask my any reasonable question, and I'll answer. / Nicole: Won't work. We'll need EXPERT analysis. That's why I want you to go see Nick's uncle, prof. Wisebottom. / Fred: "Daniel, to prove your innocence, please step into the lion's den." http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050114.html

Fred: I _refuse_ to let that crotchety old crackpot poke and prod me, even in the name of defending me from Trent! / Fooker: Aw, c'mon, Fred... / Fooker: You're gone to Nick's family's place for Christmas, what, twice now? And Wisebottom hasn't dissected you yet. / Fred: No, but he and Nick's mom delight in discussing it. / Fred: Look, I was in that lab for months, and the only reason I survived was because I clammed up. Wisebottom may not have been there, but I see that gleam in his eye every time. / Mrs. Duncan: Then without objective proof, Trent's already won. / Mrs. Duncan: It's either him, or some other biologist who has never seen a sentient slime mold before. / Fred: Sigh. I'll do it. / Fooker: Kewl. I haven't done my "wrinkly old guy" bit in years. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050115.html

How are you doing this evening, Fredrick? / Fred: Fine, as long as you keep your tools to yourself. / Otto: Not to worry, my dear colloidal friend! There will be no poking and prodding tonight!

[[Scene description. NOTE: this is a colored strip.

You are unlike any of the 650 or so species of myxogastrids and dictyostelids on record, which leads me to believe you are your own unique species. / Professor Wisebottom: In fact, your genetic structure is different from any dna I've ever seen. Perhaps some more in-depth study can - - / Fred: Can you get to some sort of point, prof.? / Professor Wisebottom: Well, if all else fails, I can declare you an endangered species and procure you government protection... / Fred: Considering that I'd fully expect Trent to shoot a bald eagle if he saw one, I'd doubt that would help. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050117.html

It is one thing to feel and suffer, but another to act with intelligence. BOTH will be required to prove you a person in the eyes of the law. / [[Shot from behind dr. Wisebottom, showing Fred raising a "hand" to his "chin"]] / Dr. Wisebottom: We must prove you posssess a conscious mind, with plans, goals, desires, hopes, and fears. We must prove you are self-aware, that you have a personal identity. Only then will the court see you as a being with moral rights and responsibilities. / [[Fred takes up center-stage as he replies to Dr. Wisebottom on the left. In the right, Fooker wispers to Nicole]] / Fred: So you want me to take an IQ test, huh? Suits me fine.

http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050119.html
Wisebottom speaking, to Fred: Of course, the very nature of intelligence is still hotly debated. And the IQ test is far from perfect. However, it *is* the most accepted and reliable psychological test, and the typical slime mold shouldn't even register as a blip. / Wisebottom: You, of course, are far from typical, and *any* score should provide something. You might also expect to reproduce the result in court to debunk the disbelievers. / Fred: Fine. Let's *prove* I'm a genius and move on. / [[A short while later, Nicole and Fooker check in with Wisebottom...]] / Wisebottom: The test is complete, and I've calculated the result. You two may come back in now. / Nicole: How did Fred do? / Fred, reading results: *139*?!? That's *all*?! You *must* have dropped 70 or more points somewhere! / Wisebottom: He'll be fine once the shock wears off... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050119.html

And you know better than I do that he's very high maintenance. / Ki: Now any girl we set him up with is going to find that out sooner or later, and they might not be willing knowing that up-front. / Sharon: But he's grown! He's come so far since then! / Sharon: Guys, back me up here. Hasn't Dex grown since we've gotten to know him? / Fooker: Did you hear something, Nick?

[[Ki, Sharon, Fooker, and Nick are sitting around a table, discussing Dexter]] / Sharon: Seriously, I think if we can just get his confidence back up, he'll be back on the dating scene in no time. / Nick: Just who could we set him up with? / Sharon: What about that girl you were telling me about from Regional? / Fooker: Who, Amy? I'm not sure a mattress with hair is exactly Dexter's type... / Sharon: No, not her. The other one, who hangs around with the two guys always stalking you... / Fooker: Oh, Patty! Eh, maybe. But she's sharp, in more ways than one. Dex would need to be on his toes. / Nick: Wait a sec... two guys stalking you? / Fooker: Yeah, they seem to follow me around, watching me. Guess they don't have enough work to do... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041202.html

Nick: What about that girl from upstairs at Magitek? I've never seen her with a guy. / Sharon: I think that's because she's not interested in guys, though... / Ki: Well, there IS one girl we know who is unattached and desperate for attention herself... / Nick: Oh, no you don't. We're NOT getting TRISH involved in this... / Ki: Okay, so she's a bit ODD. But we ALL are in some fashion. She's a GEEK. And she's female and available. / Nick: And when they first met, she dropped Dex at the city dump with no memories of that night. / Fooker: I guess if you're gonna DUMP him, that's the place to do it. / Nick: He'd just REFUSE her offer anyway. / Fooker: What a WASTE. / Ki: Are you done? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041203.html

I shouldn't really be talking about it if it is... / Fooker: Actually, no. I have this friend, and... / Patty: Oh, I get it. Your desperate pal is hard up for a date, so you think since I'm happily single I'll take pity on him. Am I close? / Fooker: I'll up your disk quota to 100GB... / Patty: Fine.

I appreciate your advice. / Dexter: How is the lawsuit coming? / Fred: We've got a date. Nicole and I are working on my defense. We just need to figure out our strategy. Meanwhile, Trent's as annoying as ever. / Fred: I still don't see what good I'll be in "prepping" you, Dex, especially considering the last time... / Dexter: I need moral support, Fred. And I think you did great. I screwed up last time. / Dexter: Besides, with everyone else meeting me there, I don't have anyone to turn to beforehand to get my confidence up. I need a pre-game pep rally to warm up. / [[Dexter starts to open door.]] / Dexter: I mean, my self-esteem as been pretty low lately, I keep fearing something is going to go horribly wrong...

I was a little reluctant given our, um, HISTORY, but I wanted to give it another try. / Dexter: "Our HISTORY?" You mean how you were "desparate" after Nick spurned you, so you picked me up, then later left me at the city dump with no memories of it? / Trish: [[looks sheepish]] Um, yeah. / Dexter: Sigh...

Why don't we ditch them and go somewhere else on our own? / Dexter: Forgive me, but I think it might be in both our best interests to do the triple date thing for now. / Trish (thought bubble): But I can't brainwash and reprogram you to help me get into Nick's lab with them around, you great tub of lard! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20041207.html

How do me an' Perseffome look? / Dwayne: Very pretty! The best flower girls ever! / Persephone: Mr. Duncan, you should see Ki! She's absolutely gorgeous! If I had tear ducts, I'd cry! / Dwayne: Well, you girls will give her a run for her money. / Nicole: I'm not sure about that.

Nick is going to be falling all over himself when he sees you. / Ki: He better not. I'll need him to keep _me_ steady. / Sharon: Getting nervous? Cold feet? / Ki: Nervous, yes. Cold feet, no. I know this is the right step for us, but it's a big one. I just hope I'll make him as happy as he makes me. / Sharon: I can't think of a couple who deserve each other more than you two.

[[We are shown the typewritten letter]] My dearest Ki, It is with a heavy heart that I write this. While I love you with every fiber of my being, I'm afraid I can't go through with the wedding. It's too complicated to explain in such a simple letter, but I must leave now. I don't know when I'll be back, but I promise I will try to contact you soon. / Ki: I-I don't believe it... / Patty: I'm sorry, Ki. I don't know what to say that can help... / [[Ki crumples up the letter]] / Ki: No, I don't *believe* this. Nick would *never* write a load of garbage like this. *Something's* happened, but I know my Nick well enough to know he wouldn't do *this* to me. / Ki: Fooker? Do you agree? / Fooker: Absoposilutely. Thought the exact same thing. Nick's vanished, and I'll bet it was against his free will. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060112.html

A little handwriting analysis could answer that for sure. / Sharon: Was there any other evidence? / Fooker: His door was locked. No sign of forced entry. His tux and suitcases were still ready to go.

Allow me to formally get out of this gown and I'll formally kick your-- / Fooker: Wait, Ki! / Fooker: You can't rip her a new one, not until we find out what's going on. / Ki: Why the heck not? / Fooker: That's NOT our Trudy! / Ki: How would YOU know? / Fooker: Because I KNOW where our Trudy is, and she's NOT here.

I _knew_ he was untrustworthy! At least _my_ child is here. / Charles Wellington: Actually, your _son_ still hasn't arrived, so we're technically one-for-one. / {{Actually, Yoshi has arrived, supporting someone who appears to be Trudy from another universe/dimension/timeline/reality, but Dwayne must not have mentioned this when he told the parents about Nick's disappearance.}} / Linda Wellington: Technically, dear, we're down two, since Lori can't get here. / Charles Wellington: Quite right.

She needed my help! / Mr. Oshiro: Indeed! I am sure this "Trudy" person has only served to further your "education." I was 15 once.

And "Pseudo-Trudy"... All we have on her is Fooker's word that she's not "our" Trudy. But I was ready to rip her limb from limb. Have I gone completely mental? / [[Sharon leans forward]] / Sharon: After all Trudy did in the past, I could understand your anger toward her "twin." As to Trish, you've been under a lot of stress this week, with very little sleep. You're not firing on all thrusters. / Sharon: You've got a rather obsessive father that you're trying to please, and you're worried about offending the Wellingtons. And now with Nick missing, you've lost your last real source of strength. / [[Sharon and Ki look sad]] / Sharon: Honestly, if I would have been in your position, I would have already gone into "Sharon smash!" mode and gone bridezilla all over the place. / Ki: Thanks. I think. / [[Ki leans her head on Sharon's shoulder as Sharon looks uncomfortable]] / Ki: Do you think time just had a Blue Screen of Death, and we could just reboot today? / Sharon: If we can, can we skip the part where "Trudy" looks at me like I'm made of chocolate? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060122.html

Nick Wellington has disappeared. While he supposedly left Ms. Oshiro this "Dear John" letter, it is the agreement of his friends that this is uncharacteristic of him. It must be fake. / Agent #12: A forensic sweep of his apartment by Team Beta turned up nothing, nor has our surveillance equipment picked up anything unusual. / Ki: Surveillance equipment? You had Nick bugged? / Agent #12: Nick has been labelled a "person of interest" ever since the New York incident in 2002. / Agent #18: When you invent the most powerful weapon known to man, people tend to take notice. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060124.html

We didn't talk last night. / Ki: After we left the church, Sharon and the girls took me to her apartment for my bachelorette party.

Agent #18: Our records are incomplete on this "Mutex" device. We've had conflicting reports... / Maddie: And who exactly is this "Trish"? / Ki: Patricia Marshall. She's been a real enigma for us, so we were hoping you guys could explain her. She showed up a few years ago and has been shadowing Nick for some time, always asking about his inventions... / Ki: She acted very weird, claiming to have multiple personalities. If she didn't, she sure acted like two different people. / Trudy: [[offscreen]] That's because she was two different people. / Trudy: [[in the doorway]] And the same person at the same time, from a certain point of view.

Good Trudy: I apologize for my appearance. I practically went through hell to get here. I also apologize for involving Yoshi. He wasn't my first choice of contact, but he proved to be the most opportune. / Ki: Who exactly are you? / Good Trudy: I am Trudy Trueheart, but not the one you are familiar with. I lead a small band of patriots seeking to liberate my world from an oppresive tyrant. / Good Trudy: I am well acquainted with the "evil" Trish you encountered, as she was from my world too. And if one of your agents could bring in their "guest" as this involves her as well, I'll try to explain. / Good Trudy: You see, just as "evil" Trish was the "opposite" of the "timid" Trish you once met, I am the "opposite" of this woman, the Trudy you first met seven years ago. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060128.html

He hasn't had any sleep since he arrived, aside from the brief anesthetic to transfer him from the landing zone to here. / Duchess Ki: He is showing evidence of the strain, but he still resists, and I think he suspects something isn't right. / Lord Nick: Really? / Lord Nick: Curious. Perhaps he isn't as blindly trusting as we thought. Refresh yourself on the surveillance footage of your counterpart. Your performance must be believable. / Lord Nick: I will initiate our fail-safe plans, just in case.

Nick: [[Yelling]] KI! Where are you? This isn't funny! / Nick: [[Thinking]] Well, it could have been. Once she finally shared her "Counsel of Ethendale" novel with me, I kind of hoped I could make her a virtual reality version to play with. / Nick: [[Thinking]] Of course, this wasn't part of the novel yet. She told me she was thinking of adding the scene, but she hadn't finalized it yet. I would think she was trying to get a feel for how it flowed... / Nick: [[Thinking]] ... if that were the real Ki. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060130.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060131.html
Nick: "I read your documentation!" And she said it just hours after she heard me tell Trish I didn't take notes. The real Ki would've known that anyway. / Nick: There are several things "off" about her, but that was the clincher. Then all the smaller things could no longer be ignored. Who is she? What does she want? / Nick: Physically, I can't tell a difference. Her face, hair, smell... even that tiny little mole on her neck she usually keeps hidden. Whoever she is, she went to a lot of effort to fool me. / Nick: The old Nick might have innocently let that slide, but Trudy then Trish taught me to be more suspicious. And suspicious is a mild word for where I am now. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060131.html

Only part of Nick's head is seen, and behind it is an empty room, with no visible doors or windows.]] / Nick, thinking: I have a vague memory of an all white room, then a blank, followed by finding myself here. I can't prove it, but I suspect I made an unscheduled intermediate stop. Unscheduled by _me_, that is. / [[Back to the forest.]] / Nick, thinking: The sensory experience is different here, kind of like my first MUTEX experiment. That was true VR, with that odd sense the reality wasn't quite right, even if it looked it. I never got that after I hooked it up to Velociraptor... / [[Nick holds the sword in both hands and looks at the blade.]] / ... After it became an interdimensional transport. So I'm _not_ connected to the MUTEX anymore. I'm in a true virtual reality, but whose, and where? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060201.html

My "host" must want to keep me unplugged. / [[Nick frowns and puts his hand to his chin, concentrating.]] / Nick, thinking: And she chose a low-tech fantasy setting to minimize my chances of hacking the VR. Clever. So I have to play her game for now. At least now I'm actively playing and not just being played. / Nick, thinking: I can't let her know that I know. If she knows that I know, she might change tactics. But how do I know she doesn't know that I know? I know she knows that I know I'm "in" the MUTEX, but does she know that I know she knows that I know? / [[Nick puts his hand to his forehead. His face looks partly tired, partly sad.]] / Nick, thinking: Oh _NO_... Now I'm doing bad comedy routines by myself in my head.

[[The wedding party and UGA agents are assembled in a room. Trudy from the alternate universe addresses the group.]] / Alternate Trudy: What I am about to tell you will most likely be difficult to comprehend, but if what I've heard about this group is true, the bizarre is often routine here. / Alternate Trudy: "Timid" Trish, like the Trudy Trueheart sitting among you, is a true inhabitant of this universe. "Evil" Trish and myself, however, are not. We come from an alternate universe, similar yet vastly different from your own. / [[Agent #18 scowls.

[[Ki addresses Trudy from the alternate universe, who looks stern throughout the strip.]] / Ki: We've learned through the MUTEX that alternate dimensions apparently exist. If Nick's superheroes have their own universe, why can't there be other versions of _us_ somewhere? / Alternate Trudy: Precisely. From the very limited information I've gleaned from my travels, there could well be an infinite number of universes in existence. Each one could be a minute variation upon another. / Alternate Trudy: Given enough permutations, vast differences can occur. Enemies become allies, heroes become villains. An innocent joke about taking over the world becomes a sinister threat, then a terrible reality. / [[Ki becomes wide-eyed with surprise.]] / Alternate Trudy: I'm afraid, Ms. Oshiro, that your adversary in this mystery will be both strangely alien and as familiar as looking in a mirror... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060207.html

[[Ki appears astonished. She addresses Trudy from the alternate universe.]] / Ki: Are you saying... your universe's version of _me_ kidnapped Nick? / Alternate Trudy: Yes, although she was not the mastermind of the scheme. / Fooker: Then who, pray tell, is? / Alternate Trudy: Emperor Nicholas the Puissant, the counterpart of your Nicholas Wellington. / Alternate Trudy: In fact, many of you in your "alternate" forms are a part of his oppressive regime, a world-wide totalitarian government that rules through terror and fear. / Dexter: Nick as a fascist dictator? _That's_ definitely hard to swallow... / Fooker: If he doesn't have a goatee, I'll be sorely disappointed. / [[Patty glares at Fooker.]] http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060208.html

Alternate Fooker is leering at Alternate Trudy, who shrinks back and looks intimidated.

[[As Nega Nick and Nega Ki look gleeful, a shadowed "F**k*r" stands in the doorway]] / Narrator{{Nega Trudy}}: Needless to say, gaining economic control over the world does not go unnoticed. It wasn't long before the UGA sent in their top agent, who was surprisingly close. / [[F**k*r counts some bundled dollar bills as Nega Nick smokes a cigar]] / Narrator: But Nick was cunning. He knew Barker well enough to know he could be bought. Before long, Nick not only had Barker on his payroll, but the entire UGA. / [[A man in a gray suit sees a man in a blue suit stabbed in the back, with a "N" insignia card in his hand]] / Narrator: With the paramilitary might of the UGA behind him, Nick soon gained political control as well as financial control. Officials who could not be bought were assassinated. / [[Some tanks with the N logo roll over cars as citizens flee in a city]] / Narrator: His forces met with heavy resistance in parts of the world where democracy flourished, like China. But those he could not conquer, he set out to utterly destroy. / [[Shows Nega Dwayne, F**k*r and Nega Ki. Nega Dwayne and Ki resemble their "alternate future" counterparts"]] / Narrator: As favors to those who helped him gain power, he appointed his former coworkers to high offices. Duncan became governor of Asia, Barker general of his armies and the secret police... / [[Back in the wedding chapel, Fooker asks Nega Trudy a question as Ki looks on]] / Fooker: Out of curiosity, did Barker still have the nickname "Fooker?" / Trudy: Same consonants, different vowels. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060212.html

[[Nega Nick eyes a map while Nega Dwayne and F**k*r talk in the background]] / Narrator {{Nega Trudy}}: Even with his newfound wealth and power, the new emperor struggled to maintain control over his growing domain. Too many resistance cells sprang up to oppose him. / [[Two Nega Grays are featured, one holding a strange device.]] / Narrator: To his surprise, Barker offered a novel solution. He had been abducted a few years earlier by peaceful alien explorers. He had soundly defeated them, but kept in contact with them, just in case he needed their unique talents. / [[Nega Nick speaks with the Nega Skaboola]] / Narrator: The aliens were at war with their mortal enemies, another race from a nearby solar system. Nick quickly formed an alliance with the "Greys." If they would help him conquer the Earth, he would help defeat their enemies. / [[Nega Ki overseess some captive Greys]] / Narrator: The Greys, however, did not count on Nick's duplicity. Before they knew it, they were virtual slaves, their own technology used against them. Nick now had full control over Earth, but a new threat came from the stars. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060213.html

AlterTrudy: Now Emperor Nicholas has full control over Earth, but he is locked into an intersteallar war he does not want to fight. / Ki: Why then did he send Trish to steal the Mutex? / AlterTrudy: The Mutex? He has no interest in the virtual reality system. He already *has* one. He built it as a torture device, and only later discovered its potential interdimensional capabilities. / Fooker: I guess that explains how Trish got here. Why did she go poof? / AlterTrudy: The Emperor's Mutex does not have the power to transport organic matter. It can only create virtual avatars in other universes. / Ki [[Startled Look]]: It doesn't have the power? Nick's VR didn't start hopping dimensions until he... / AlterTrudy [[Looking Grim]]: Hooked it up to the Velociraptor free energy device. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060214.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060215.html
[[Fooker is explaining. Dexter and Patty are listening.]] / Fooker: So it's Velociraptor ol' Nega-Nick wants. With that, who cares about hopping dimensions? He'd have more than enough juice to defeat his space invaders THEN conquer alternate universes. / Nega-Trudy: Exactly. He could not transport the device itself, so his only course of action was to grab the only complete storehouse of your Nick's documentation. / Ki: Nick's skull. / Dexter: Why didn't Emperor Nick just build his own Velociraptor? / Nega-Trudy: He's tried, but the secret to making it work has eluded him. It seems such a device is rare among the universe permutations. / [[Sharon is asking Nega-Trudy. Fooker is watching them.]] / Sharon: So where do YOU fit into all this? And why are you here? / Nega-Trudy: I'm here because we have coinciding goals. You want your friend back, and I want to put an end to the Emperor's tyranny once and for all. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060215.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060216.html
AlternateTrudy: After I learned about my Nick's... true nature, I vowed to find a way to stop him. I joined a small resistance cell called C.R.U.D.E: Crusaders Ready to Unseat the Despotic Emperor. / [[At the mention of C.R.U.D.E., the UGA agents all look at one another]] / AlternateTrudy: Because of my familiarity with the emperor, I have gained a level of importance. Now almost all Earth resistance cells are centralized around us. / Ki: How do you know so much about US? / AlternateTrudy: Ever since he learned about your Nick's invention a few years ago, he has kept you under constant surveillance. One of our operatives recently acquired a copy of this data. We knew we had to contact you immediately. / Sharon: Us? Why contact us? / Alternate Trudy: Because I'm convinced you are the key to defeating the Emperor. As Shakespeare wrote, "To thine own self be true." / {{To Thine Own Self...

Ki: Hold on now. I could understand you crossing dimensions to get aid from Fooker and his secret agent pals, but the rest of us know nothing about deposing emperors. We're *geeks*. The closest we come to covert ops is playing "Rainbow Six." / Anti-Trudy: I don't think you understand, Ki. It's not your *skills* I need, it's your knowledge of *self*. One thing I have observed in comparing you to my universe's counterparts is that you are not "opposites" per se, but different parts of the same whole. / Anti-Trudy: My Ki gave in to an urge from which you restrained yourself. You made a mistake she wisely did not. You both run through the same logic processes, but with different outcomes. It is your ability to say, "If I did things differently" that I need. / Anti-Trudy: In all of us, there are moments of darkness and light. What shines forth is shown by the choices we make. You chose light, they dark. I need you to face your darkness within to learn how to overcome it. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060217.html

Fooker: Okay, you've got a deal. We'll do anything we can to help get Nick back. There's just two stipulations. / Trudy: Name them. / Fooker: First we need a way to tell each other apart from our counterparts on your side. / Trudy: Since the emperor has what he wants, he's probably not monitoring you now. We can agree on a code word for I.D. / Fooker: Secondly, I want a group of UGA agents to go first to make sure it's safe for the others. / Trudy: While I agree your agents should come, the MUTEX can only handle six people at once. I insist on the core group going first. / Trudy: If we keep those helmets clear, you have an easy escape route home. If your scientists can replicate Nick's helmet hardware, another six can use Yoshi's clone.

Trudy presents Alt. Terrell]] / Alt. Trudy: This is Trent Terrell. He is our fearless leader, and organizer of all the joined resistance cells throughout the empire. / Alt. Trudy: He's also the bravest man I've ever met, and that's probably one reason why I fell in love with him. / Alt. Terrel: I'm just trying to do my part. / Alt.

Trent 2: We appreciate your willingness to assist us. When we saw the surveillance footage our spies obtained from the palace of you, we knew you would be invaluable to us in reaching our goals. / Trent 2: It was Dr. Nefu and Miss Nicht who discovered a way to intercept and hijack the Mutex's transport beam. While we were unable to stop the Duchess from kidnapping your friend, it did give us a chance to use your Yoshi's clone to transport Trudy to your world. / Trent 2: I just received word that your second team has arrived and is being led here now. / Fooker: Now that we're here, how do you expect us to be able to help? / Trent 2: Assuming there is at least some shared history between you and our universe's counterparts, I'm hoping you'll have valuable information that we can use to bypass their security. / Butch Kilgore 2: Excuse me, Mr. Terrell, but they're back. / Trent 2: Excellent. Show them in. First, I'd like you to meet two of our most valuable spies... / Trent 2 (offscreen): Drones 3141592 and 6626168, but we call them Pi and Planck. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060305.html

Trudy, Pi, and Planck talking]] / Alt. Trudy: But you still don't believe these people are from another universe, Pi? / Pi: Please. I'd sooner believe he was a clone, even given your primitive medical technology. / [[Pi talking]] / Pi: It's a scientifically proven fact that alternate realities cannot exist. Time and space cannot exceed the four perceivable dimensions. To believe in in alternate realities requires... I don't know... / [[Planck and Pi talking]] / Planck: The limitless energy of the unfettered human imagination? / Pi: I was going to say a really gullible idiot, but that works. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060306.html

Trudy 2: Pi and Planck are our ties to the Greys, who are ready to join us if they can be freed from their gulags. / Planck: We sneak back and forth easily, 'cause you humans can't tell us apart. [[Switches hats with Pi.]] / Trent 2: They are also our primary sources of information about what goes on in the palace. They were the ones who acquired the surveillance footage. / Pi: Which is a good segue into tonight's mission. [[Reclaims hat.]] / Trent 2: Excellent. What have you learned? / Pi: The prisoner is under tight security. Only the Emperor and his top advisors can get in. Springing him won't be easy. / Ki: Are you talking about Nick? / Pi: I don't know his name. But I know he's pretty important. I know the Emperor is personally supervising his interrogation. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060307.html

Some of you can sleep in me and Pi's room, since we technically don't sleep. A few others volunteered their rooms for you guys to use. / [[Dexter, Fooker, Ki, and Trudy talking]] / Fooker: Why don't you girls take this room, while the guys get the next. / Dexter: Assuming Ki and Trudy don't kill each other... / Ki and Trudy: Shut up, Dexter. / [[Planck talking to Sharon, while something in Ki's backpack startles her]] / Planck: This place is kind of cozy once you get used to it.

When I learned you too had created the Mutex, I was ecstatic. Then you did something I only dreamed of ... / Alter-Nick: With this marvelous Velociraptor device, your Mutex allowed you to cross dimensional boundaries.

No, I never sent her.

You are a lot like her. / Trudy 2: As I tried to explain, not everything here is a mirror of your world. Our Maddie O'Hara was a just, noble person and a faithful UGA agent. In fact, she was one of the few who didn't join the Emperor, and sadly paid for her loyalty with her life. / Agent #12 (Maddie O'Hara): You sound like you knew her very well... / Trudy 2: [[sadly]] Eventually, yes. We spent a lot of time trying to coax Barker away from Nick before she was executed. / Trudy 2: It was during that time that I learned of the special bond between us... a bond that you two share as well... / [[Agent #12 and Trudy look at each other, nonplussed.]] http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20060327.html

Given time, I think you'll prove yourself to those who doubt you. / [[Trudy looks down in seeming shame.]] / Trudy 2: It won't be easy.

She begged me to find this girl and try to make things up to her before our mother died. / [[Trudy is startled.]] / Trudy 2: At first, I was annoyed. I had far more "important" things to do for myself. But the task changed me. I started looking outward instead of in, and when I found her, that meeting changed me forever. / Trudy: I have a sister too.

So I CAN'T be Trudy's sister! / Agent #12: [[pointing at Sharon]] Bad news, Murphy... / Agent #12: So was I, and she just said Trueheart's sister was given up for adoption. That makes us BOTH potential candidates. / Sharon: We'll see about that. I happen to know my birth mother's name. / Agent #12: And that is...? / Sharon: Er, Esther Matusevitch. Either that or Elsbeth Diederich. / Agent #12: You're not sure? / Sharon: Okay, they both could be fake names. But I'm almost positive she's used them both. She's... on the FBI's Most Wanted list. / Agent #12: No wonder those sounded familiar. / Agent #12: I happen to know my birth mother's name as well: Gisela Wagner. I've done some research, and I know she lives in... What? / [[Trudy looks extremely rattled.]] / Trudy: E-Esther Matusevitch.

You'll have time to talk later tonight. / Trudy 2: Right now, I want to finish OUR conversation. There's a reason I insisted that you come on this mission, and it has less to do with your friends needing your help than you needing theirs. / [[Agent #12 (Maddie O'Hara) watches them out of the corner of her eye.]] / Trudy 2: You came with the UGA team to see Barker, to apologize for what you've done. You knew it was too much to ask forgiveness, but you still had to express your regret, hoping he would pass it on to the others. You didn't expect to tag along on this adventure. / Trudy 2: But I see this as your chance to put words into action.

I seek out those who commit crimes and see to it that they are brought to justice. And I hope they receive the punishment they deserve. / Agent #12: But I've seen my share of repentant souls who were genuinely sorry for their actions.

When I was at the end of my rope, helpless and suicidal, a man showed me a level of kindness I thought was impossible. And he reminded me of Nick more than I'd care to admit. / [[View is now of Ki, listening impassively.]] / Trudy: I think it was then that the full weight of what I said hit me. Yes, I did love him. He saw things in me that I had buried deep below selfishness and greed.

We would have known if they had infiltrated the rebels! / C: Hmph. Maybe you did find them, if you catch my drift. / Pi: What about Planck? Was he affected? / C: Yes.

Gnarf, Terrell's whole plan could be a trap perpetrated from within! And with the passage to the sewers blocked, we have no way of confirming it. / C: So? Why should we care?

You did not just say that! / Pi: Oh, quit your groveling, Planck. Seriously, when was the last time you felt the Skaboola's influence? / C: Not... for a while... / Pi: Not for a very long while. We all know who got the raw end of the deal with the emperor. Even the Skaboola isn't that gzak-brained. / Pi: No, we've been slowly growing more autonomous for years.

Instead, his influence has just diminished. / [[Planck starts work on the hydraulics]] / Planck: Diminished to non-existence, you mean? / Pi: Yes, gzak-brain.

By now you'ver probably heard the theory i've told 'C,' The skaboola, for whatever reason, no longer controls us and, by association, neither does The Emperor! / Pi: It's time we did what was right!

Once more onto the beach, and let's sic our dogs on the poor! / Planck [off camera as other clones look at each other confused]: Never in the field of drone conflict was so much owned by so many who only had a few.

Nick: Hey, Fooker. Check out the Kewl new Java applet I wrote for my web page. / Fooker: Waitaminute / Fooker: You mean to tell me you write computer programs all day at work, then go home and write more programs to relax? / Nick: Uh, yeah... / Fooker: DUDE!!! / [[Nick & Fooker Hi-Five]] <> http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/19990201.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/19990202.html
Fooker: Dude, I thought I was the only man on earth geeky enough to code for a living and code at home for fun. It's good to know I'm not alone. / Nick: Ditto. / Nick: I mean, I enjoy writting programs, but at least it's a different project I work on at home. That's the only sane way I could actually do it. / Fooker: There's nothing sane about us, my brother in geekdom. We are insanity incarnate. / Nick: Boola boola. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/19990202.html

Fooker: As you can see, chief, that java applet Nick designed could have tons of uses. I'm thinking we could incorporate it into the company web site... / Dwayne: Uh, sure, Fooker... / Dwayne: But when are you going to find time to overhaul our web site ? We're in the middle of a major project... / Fooker: Nick and I will do it in our spare time. / Dwayne: Uh... don't you two have anything better to do in your spare time, like, say, have a social life ? / Fooker: Social life ? What's that, sir ? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/19990203.html

Dwayne: Look, guys. I admire your enthusiasm and work ethic, but you need to relax. I don't want you writing your own programs at home after work anymore. / Nick: But writing programs is HOW we relax. / Dwayne: You're missing my point. You code at work for a job. You shouldn't code at home for fun. You'll burn yourselves out! It's not normal! / Fooker: But we're NOT normal, Dwayne. We're geeks. We do this sort of thing. / Dwayne: I'm starting to thing you guys need professional help. / Fooker: Nah. Tech support's a joke. They just put you on hold. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/19990204.html

Nick: Dropped by the post office. Looks like we've got another present from one of your relatives. / Ki: From Uncle Sakio out in California! / Nick: I didn't know you had this many relatives... / Ki: Well, they're scattered all over the globe. I doubt you'll ever meet all of them. / Nick: I can't believe we've gotten this many gifts already... / Ki: Well, the wedding is only a couple months away! Most of these are from people that won't be able to make it. / Ki: Oh boy. Another can opener. / Nick: At least this one isn't white. I'll put it with the other six. / Ki: You'd think that after this many years of both of us living on our own, they'd realize we already have two can openers between us... / Nick: I suppose it could be worse... / Nick: It could be the little pig in a straw hat, sundress, and sunglasses... / Ki: You don't know my Aunt Wei.

Mom and Dad were okay with it and will take it from there. / Ki: Good. We still need to buy gifts for the wedding party. / Ki: Sharon and I had our final fittings yesterday. We got Lori's measurements via email. But the tailor isn't happy doing it long distance. Sharon, though, looks gorgeous in her gown. Fooker's going to love it. / Nick: I'm more concerned about what YOUR gown wlil look like... / Ki: Trust me. You'll love it.

Nick: I picked up some of the legal paperwork. / Ki: Legal paperwork? / Nick: Yeah, ya know, license application, name change forms, etc. / Ki: Name change forms... Wow. I guess I've been so busy, I haven't thought about that for a while... / Nick: Well, I kinda have been... / Nick: I know a lot of modern women feel they lose part of their identity when they take their husband's last name, so if that bothers you, I won't object if you want to keep "Oshiro" as your last name... / Ki: Silly. Of COURSE I'll take your name. It HAS to be easier for others to spell than Oshiro. / Nick: As long as we don't name any kids "Beef" we should be okay... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050920.html

I think Sharon's in on it too. I haven't told them, of course, since we agreed to keep it a secret, but they're very persistent... / Nick: Are you okay? You got very quiet all of the sudden... / Ki: I'm sorry. I didn't call you over to talk wedding stuff. Really. It's... something you need to know. / Ki: I haven't told you, because it's the past, and that's where it belongs. But you deserve to know, as it explains a lot of things. / Ki: It's time I told you about Sam. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050921.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050922.html
Nick: Sam? You mean the old boyfriend your dad called an "unpleasant experience"? / Ki: Dad was being tactful, which you now know is a feat on its own. / Ki: You've always accepted me for who I am NOW. You've been patient and never pressed me to elaborate on my past. But you deserve to know about this before you marry me... to know about my darkest moments. / Nick: It's up to you if you really want to tell me. But I'll go ahead and say now that nothing in your past could ever make me love you less. The past can never change, but the future is ours to write. / Ki: This coming from the man whose uncle invented a time machine... / Nick: Leave it to Uncle Wise to ruin a good motivational speech by violating the laws of physics. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050922.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050923.html
Ki: You already know that Fooker and I both went to college near here, and how we met. We hung out a lot, even after he graduated. / Ki: Fooker tutored me in some of my advanced classes, and eventually I decidied to return the favor and tutor other students. I alternated that and working part-time at GPF for a couple years. / [[Flashback to college days. Ki is tutoring Josh]] / Ki voiceover: Most of the people I tutored did really well, and I almost considered becoming a teacher. But there was one football player who had a really hard time with algebra, and I spent a long time working with him. / [[Sam approaches the table. Josh gives him a thumbs-up sign; Ki looks astonished]] / Ki voiceover: Of course, this wasn't about him. But without Josh, I never would have met Sam... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050923.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050924.html
[[Image of Sam with a football]] / Ki voiceover: Sam was the star running back. He was smart, athletic, and came from a fairly wealthy family. Needless to say, most girls drooled over him. / Ki voiceover: Of course, you know me. Just because a guy is "hot" doesn't necessarily mean he's going to impress *me*. / Ki: Excuse us. Josh is busy studying. Can you talk to him later? / Sam [[whispering to Ki]]: Watch Josh. He has a hard time reducing polynomials. I'd hate to see what happens if he ever ends up having to find the best "Big-Oh" approximation of one. That'll be a hoot. / [[Sam walks away, winking and giving Ki the thumbs-up sign. Ki smiles]] / Ki voiceover: Of course, a firm grasp of discrete mathematics--or any display of high intelligence--is another matter. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050924.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050925.html
Ki: [[narrating]] Ordinarily, Sam and I wouldn't have had much in common. His family was wealthy, mine middle class. He was a jock; I was a geek. We were from totally different worlds. / Ki: [[narrating]] But because of tutoring Josh, I spent more time than usual among the football team, and that put me in near constant contact with Sam. / Sam: Hey, Josh! You're up! / Josh: Be right back. / Sam: Hi! Let's see... it's Ki, right? / Ki: Yeah. Josh says you're Sam. / Sam: It's great that you're helping Josh out. He's a cool guy, a big teddy bear. But his math skills are abysmal, and the coach won't let him play if his grades slip too much. / Ki: He's doing okay. He just has trouble grasping certain concepts. Some people are wired differently than others. I used to golf with my dad, but I'm much more comfortable in front of a computer. / Sam: Well, thanks. I need him to block for me, and he can't do that if he can't factor a polynomial. / Sam: [[winks at Ki]] Come to tomorrow's game, and if we win, why don't the three of us celebrate? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050925.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050926.html
Ki: [[narrating]] And of course they won. Our team was best in its division. Several of our players were rumored to be Heisman hopefuls, including Sam. / Ki: [[narrating]] I joined some of the guys and their girlfriends for a party that night. I met Josh's girlfriend Nanese, who was just as sweet as he was. / Ki: [[narrating]] Josh said that Sam had been asking about me ever since we met in the library. With all the cheerleaders hanging off him, I didn't see why he'd show me any interest. / Ki: [[narrating]] But every now and then, I'd catch him glancing my way or flashing me that friendly smile. A few times, it seemed like we were the only ones in the room. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050926.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050927.html
Ki as narrator: For some reason, I still didn't quite believe Josh's insistence that Sam was interested. But I thought I'd give him a shot just in case. / Ki as narrator: I was just heading to the athletics building to find him when... / Ki: Sam? What are you doing in the CS dept.? / Sam: Uh, looking for you...? / Ki: Oh, REALLY. Why? / Sam: Well, uh, we didn't really get to talk much at the party, so I thought, maybe, if you're not TOO busy tomorrow night... / Ki: Funny. I was just on my way to go as YOU out... / Sam: I've never been asked out by a girl before, but I imagine YOU would have been a lot better at it. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050927.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050928.html
Fooker: What are YOU so happy for? Did you finally get your laptop up to a whopping 64MB of RAM? / Ki: Better. I've got a date tomorrow! / Geek 1: A CS geek on a date?! It's... it's unheard of! / Geek 3: She's female. Maybe it's different. / Geek 2: Is there enough data to determine a precedent? / Fooker: Quiet, you three! Who's the lucky guy, if you don't mind my asking? / Ki: I met him through a guy I've been tutoring. His name is Sam, and he's a running back on the football team... / Geek 1: Ack! A geek dating a jock! A FEMALE geek dating someone popular! / Geek 2: Our universe is collapsing! / Geek 3: Or maybe infinitely expanding... / Fooker: We have GOT to find a new lunch table... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050928.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050929.html
Fooker: So you're really going out with this football player... Sam, was it? / Ki: It's just one date. It's not like I'm going to marry him. / Fooker: I'm just looking out for you, is all. You've been looking out for me with my drinking problem, so... well... / Ki: Now you're going all big brother on me. How sweet. / Ki: I can take care of myself, Fooker. It's not like I couldn't handle YOU when you were being a jerk. I'm a big girl, and I can fend for myself. And Sam seems to be quite the gentleman. / Fooker: Yeah, well, YOU clobbered my family jewels, but so did the jocks back in high school. I just want you to be careful is all... / Ki: [[winks]] No sweat. As long as he's not wearing a cup, I'm set. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050929.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050930.html
Ki, narrating: And Sam _was_ a perfect gentleman. Our first date was exactly what I had hoped. He picked me up at the dorm, we caught a movie, and had a nice dinner. / Ki, narrating: The dinner was a bit fancier than I expected. I felt a little underdressed, but I didn't exactly pack evening gowns to go to college. Sam, though, didn't seem to care. / Ki, narrating: Afterward, we ended up walking along the river front, talking for several hours. I learned he was an only child, and that his father expected him to take over the family business one day. Sam, however, wanted to be a civil engineer. / Ki, narrating: You know I can be aggressive sometimes, but I _never_ kissed on the first date... except once... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20050930.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051001.html
Ki: I'm sorry... I... don't want you to feel awkward hearing this. / Nick: No, it's okay. It's not like I'm getting jealous or anything... / Ki: Really ? I'm talking about being romantic with another man before you... / Nick: And although I don't know all the details, I know ultimately how it ends. / Ki: You're SURE you're okay ? I can gloss over this part, really... / Nick: No, Ki. I'm fine. Honest. This is a part of who you are. I want to hear it. / Nick: Okay, fine. If it will make you feel better... Grrr. I want to tear this Sam guy limb from limb... Grrr... / Ki: Try it again less monotone and I'll move on... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051001.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051002.html
[[Ki rests her head in Sam's chest on the campus quad]] / Ki narrating: Needless to say, that was far from our last date. Sam and I were virtually inseparable after that, and it wasn't long before we were going steady. / [[Ki and Sam are cuddling in a dim room; Ki is in shorts and a bra and Sam is in shorts]] / Ki narrating: There was one rough spot early on, where he was a little too eager to get more physical. After I warned him that I had certain standards set for myself, he backed off and respected my wishes. That didn't mean we didn't have our steamy moments, however. / [[Ki is walking with Fooker]] / Ki narrating: Fooker, true to his word, was always looking out for me. He'd ask how things were going. There's a slim chance he was a bit jealous, but he grew out of it quickly. / [[Ki introduces Fooker to Sam, who seems happy to see him at first]] / Ki narrating: I could see, though, that he and Sam weren't going to get along. Usually, they rarely crossed paths. But since I was close to both of them, I hoped they would get to be friends. / [[Fooker and Sam glare at each other over Ki's head. Ki is smiling obliviously]] / Ki narrating: It didn't happen. I'm fairly certain Sam was jealous of the time I spent with Fooker, and I don't know if Fooker just didn't trust Sam or what, but I could tell the friction was mutual. / [[Ki is smiling while Fooker and Sam bump shoulders and glare at each other]] / Ki narrating: Maybe optimism blinded me, or I was too in love to really notice, but I was in the middle of a powder keg, holding the lit fuse... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051002.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051003.html
Ki: [[narrating]] Weeks turned into months, months turned into a year, and Sam and I were still an item. Sure, I had had boyfriends in the past, but Sam was different. He was special. / Ki: [[narrating]] He constantly felt the need to buy me things. He even bought me a new computer when my old one died. But I insisted that it wasn't necessary. It wasn't expensive things that made me love him. / Ki: [[narrating]] One day he took me to a nearby park we would often visit (and more than once made out in a secluded glen). As we talked, he told me he had another present for me. / Ki: [[narrating]] I started to remind him that it wasn't baubles that I wanted, but he told me this was one time he wouldn't take no for an answer. / Sam: [[holds out engagement ring]] / Ki: [[narrating]] And no wasn't the answer he got. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051003.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051004.html
Ki: [[narrating]] Of course, while I told Mom all about my boyfriends, Dad took very little interest. That changed, of course, the instant they heard of the engagement. We flew home on Thanksgiving so they could meet Sam. / Ki: [[narrating]] Mom was Mom. She was happy so long as I was happy. Sam seemed to sufficiently impress her (there was a comment about his muscles I'd rather not hear from my mother). That left Dad's approval. / Ki: [[narrating]] Dad, of course, was not as warm as Mom. He had hoped I would have found an Asian boy to settle down with, but with some gentle prodding from Mom, he seemed to accept Sam... Especially when he heard how much his dad made. / Ki: [[narrating]] Mind you, Dad was a bit more open-minded then. Before long, Sam was making contacts for Dad, and helped get him a managerial position at one of Sam's dad's nearby plants. I felt like part of a business transaction, but at least Dad was happy. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051004.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051005.html
Ki: [[narrating]] At Christmas, it was my turn to meet his parents. If you can remember the culture shock of meeting my dad, imagine applying it to his family. It was like another world. / Ki: [[narrating]] Sam's mother was polite, but had an air of superiority about her. I felt like Eliza Doolittle around her, like "common rabble". Sam would defend me to a point, but I could tell she held a good deal of sway over her son. / Ki: [[narrating]] His dad was... a puzzle. He was a self-made man, who obviously worked hard to be where he was. To that end, he had little problem with my more humble origins, but he was very traditional, and a strong woman was not someone he had a lot of experience with. / Ki: [[narrating]] The entire weekend was awkward. I felt that every time I left the room, hushed conversations began, and whispers died when I would enter. And Sam's friendly smile never appeared unless we were alone. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051005.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051006.html
[[Ki is holding a snowball out to an upset Sam]] / Ki narrating: Going back to school felt odd after Christmas. Sam was a little more distant at first, but with a little coaxing, I got him back to his old self. / [[Ki holds a "Party" sheet of paper, while Sam, surprised, apparently refuses]] / Ki narrating: But I did notice some other subtle changes. He didn't open a door here, canceled a date for ball practice there... I didn't pay it much mind, but chalked it up to being comfortable with each other. / [[Ki looks concerned while others whisper in the background]] / Ki narrating: I noticed the way others acted around us changed as well. The cheerleaders would whisper when I was around, and the football players (except Josh) seemed a little too joking. Same would occasionally argue with them, but I didn't know about what. / [Fooker trips and drops his food. Sam and two others laugh while Ki appears annoyed.]]. / Ki narrating: There was one thing, though, that he could always agree with the players about, and I didn't like it one bit. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051006.html

[[Sam looks at Ki's back as she scowls with her arms crossed.]] / Sam: HEY, BABY! THE TEAM'S DRIVING OUT TO LAKE MURPHY FOR A PRE-GAME BASH! WANNA COME? / Ki: I DON'T THINK SO. / Sam: WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? / [[Ki angrily points at a smiling Sam.]] / Ki: I DON'T LIKE HOW YOU MAKE FUN OF FOOKER. / Sam: HEH. WITH A NAME LIKE THAT, HE'S ASKING FOR IT! / Ki: WILL YOU SHUT UP AND _LISTEN_? / [[Ki points at an abashed Sam.]] / Ki: FOOKER IS MY FRIEND. HE'S HELPED ME THROUGH TOUGH SPOTS, AND I'VE HELPED HIM. I HAD HOPED YOU TWO WOULD BECOME PALS. BUT IF NOT, I AT LEAST EXPECT YOU TO RESPECT HIM. IF ONLY FOR MY SAKE. / [[Ki scowls over her shoulder at an angry Sam.]] / Sam: OKAY, OKAY. THE GUY'S A TOTAL DORK. BUT I'LL LEAVE HIM ALONE. HE'S STILL A GEEK, THOUGH. / Ki: WELL, SO AM _I_. DON'T FORGET THAT. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051007.html

BUT IT TAKES SO LONG TO FIX. I'M GOING TO WEAR IT UP FOR THE WEDDING: A SHORT BOB WOULD BE EASIER. / [[Ki stops looking in the mirror and turns around to talk with Sam while he looks over his shoulder.]] / Sam: YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. / Ki: MAYBE I _DO_. I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE. IT WOULD BE EASIER TO MANAGE, AND IT WOULDN'T GET IN THE WAY WHEN WE SNUGGLE. / [[Ki and Sam look at each other over their shoulders while scowling.]] / Sam: WELL. _I_ DON'T WANT YOU TO CUT IT. / Ki: OKAY.

[[Ki narrates her history with Sam]] / Needless to say, Sam wasn't happy. Josh told me he spent a couple hours in the gym, working out his aggressions. I wasn't very sympathetic. It was just a HAIR CUT. / But then Josh opened up what Sam had confided in him and never told me. The pressure had been really intense for him lately. NFL scouts were watching his games, and an inside source hinted that he was a frontrunner for a Heisman. / He also said Sam's parents were really pressuring him to break up with me. I never learned if it was my social class, independence, or even ethnicity they disapproved of. / [[Flashback to a conversation between Josh and Ki]] / Josh: Then there's all the teasing he gets from the cheerleaders and the team. / Ki: Teasing? What sort of teasing? / Josh: Oh... um, well, you know. / Ki: Obviously, I don't. / Josh: Er, how you're... ya know... not giving him any...? / Ki: Is THAT why everyone's laughing and snickering behind my back? Because I haven't SLEPT with him? / Josh: D-Don't hurt the messenger! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051009.html

Ki: Many years ago--I'm sad to say, as early as Junior High--I watched friends and classmakes ruin relationships with sex, hopping in the sack without thinking things through. / Ki: I watched so many mistakes, from break-ups to pregnancies to diseases, that I determined to save myself until I found the right man for me, and I'd wait, ideally, for the commitment of marriage before taking the plunge. / [[Ki takes Nick's hand]] / Ki: It was such a relief to find out _you_ felt the same way I did. Sam was... a little less understanding. Eventually, he respected my choice, but I could tell he wasn't comfortable with it. / Nick: And now all his pals and buddies find out he's not getting any... / Ki: Combined with all the other pressures facing him, he was just a _little_ bit frustrated... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051010.html

[[Sandra walks by while Ki talks with two cheerleaders]] / Ki narrating: The scuttlebutt had Sandra, the cheer squad's resident matress with hair, "servicing" Sam to make up for my "short-comings." Sandra, of course, was conveniently nowhere to be found. / [[Josh sees Sam with Sandra]] / Ki narrating: Nanese didn't believe the rumor, but Josh said he saw Sam and Sandra flirting after the last night's game. Sandra flirted with everyone, though, and I'm not going to go ballistic over something as simple as that. / [[Ki approaches Sam]] / Ki narrating: I was very cautious when I broached the topic with Sam. I calmly made it clear I wasn't accusing. I just wanted the truth. And he swore to me he hadn't slept with her, and he seemed completely sincere. / [[Ki embraces Sam]] / Ki narrating: I wasn't sure I believed him. If it WAS a lie, it was a good one. But whether it was guilt or shock that I even thought he'd cheat on me, I could tell it hurt him, and I never wanted to hurt him again. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051012.html

It's all over the school, even the CS Department! / Ki: Look, Fooker, I asked him about it, and he said it wasn't true. I believe him. / [[Fooker looks angry]] / Fooker: What's _wrong_ with you? Are you _sure_ you're the same chick who crunched my boys? Sam treats you like dirt. He ignores you, he walks all over you, and when half the campus says he cheated on you, you _defend_ him! / [[Ki looks angry]] / Ki: You don't know him like I do! I see past the lies and see him as he really is! / Fooker: Sorry, Ki. But if anyone is blind here, it's not me... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051013.html

Ki: Fooker was right, of course. There's something about love that blinds you to a person's faults. Sometimes to the point that you can't see the obvious. / Nick: Well, you're not the only one who tends to overlook glaring character flaws. / Ki: No, that's different. You always try to find the best in people, even when it's deeply buried. It's your gift and curse. / Ki: I only saw the man I fell in love with and was blinded to his changes that others saw. I could tell he was stressed. But I was so caught up in trying to buildhim up that I failed to see him tearing me down. / Ki: Near the end, I started to blame himself for his problems. I loved him, and I would do anything... ANYTHING to make things better. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051014.html

[[Ki looks at herself in the mirror]] / Ki narrating: Sam meant everything to me. I loved him with all my heart. I would do anything for him, even die for him. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him as my husband. / [[Ki picks a dress]] / Ki narrating: I couldn't do anything to help with his sports, other than cheer like any other fan. And I could only hope to please his parents by being the best daughter-in-law as I could be. / [[Ki puts on an earring]] / Ki narrating: The rumors and teasing were cruel, and I couldn't do anything to stop them from spreading, but I COULD give him the one thing I held back from him, the one thing I wanted to keep until the right moment... / [[Ki approaches Sam and surprises him]] / Ki narrating: I convinced myself that the right moment was his moment of need... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051015.html

[[Ki stands in the doorway of Sam's apartment]] / Ki narrating: Sam was rather quick and eager to accept my decision. In hindsight, I'd be rather annoyed by his lack of consideration for how hard this was for me, but I was far too nervous then to think of that. / [[Sam leans in to kiss Ki's neck]] / Ki narrating: I... did my best to throw myself into the moment and enjoy it, and there WAS a tingle of excitement about it. But there was still a part of my brain screaming in protest that nothing could silence. / [[Sam kisses Ki and carries her to the bed]] / Ki narrating: He... laid me on the bed and... started to undress me... everything began to become a blur... / [[Back to Ki telling her story to Nick]] / Nick: But... you didn't go through with it... did you... ? / [[Ki tears up]] / [[Ki start crying and hold her tears.

To Thine Own Self...: Chapter One / I can't believe it! Your wedding is in only a few days! This is so exciting! / Trust me, I know. / So we're going to pick up your family, drop your dad and brother at the hotel, and we and your mom will head to the church. Is that right? / Yeah. And as soon as Lori and Nick's mom reach town, they'll join us. / I can't believe you're this calm! I'd be a nervous wreck by now! / Oh, I am nervous. I'm just too busy and overwhelmed to show it. / Mama! Papa! Welcome! / Aiya! so this is Sharon we hear so much about! / The ticket says "meal," written in plain English. What do we get? Cheese and crackers! That is no meal! and in-flight movie? "Herbie: Fully Loaded!" I will tell you what that car is loaded full of... / I see Dad's in a good mood this afternoon... / His doctor says he need more fiber in his diet... / Peanuts give me wind! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051120.html

Um, haven't you two forgotten something? / Impossible. She packed virtually the entire house. There is nothing left to forget. / What about Yoshi? / Oh, I am sorry. I forgot to tell you. He has major paper due next week. Senior project. He will fly in day before wedding. / I thought you said he was only 15. He's already a high school senior? / College senior. He'll start his masters degree next semester. Told you he was smart. / Not smart enough. He waited until the last minute to start this project worth half his grade. / They say laziness is one of the virtues of a good programmer. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051121.html

Hola, Senor and Senora Wellington! I'm Jason, but all my pals call me Fooker. I'm your son's best man and your chauffeur for today. / Such an... interesting nickname you have there. / It's a long story involving metasyntactic variables, a fish, and copious amounts of alcohol. It's best left to ancient history. / But your chariot awaits to whisk you away to your h0tel and eventually to the church. / Is that your car? It seems nicer than what Nick described. / Actually, this is my girlfriend's. For some reason, she refused to let me pick you up in my car. I mean, it still has four wheels and a motor. That's all we really need, right? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051123.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051124.html
Hey, Fooker! I assume you got Mom and Dad here safe and sound? / Yeah, but you could have warned me. / Warned you? About what? / That your dad's a cop! He wrote me three tickets for speeding, running a stop sign, and an unsafe lane change. / You do realize he's out of his jurisdiction and these are mainly a big joke, right? / I do now, but I've got a good head of steam brewing. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051124.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051125.html
This is the part I'm dreading, Sharon... / Decorating the church? / No! The meeting of the mothers! / They've never met. They come from such different backgrounds. They have aboslutely nothing in common save that their child is marrying into a totally unknown family. / I know Mrs. Wellington has been so nice to me, but how will she react to my mom? and Mama's usually so sweet, but she has a fiery tempter. What if... if they...? / Get introduced by Nick while you ramble on? / I seriously doubt there's going to be any explosions... / Still you're just tall enough to be an effective blast shield. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051125.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051126.html
I like how you're keeping things simple, Ki. It sure makes decorating quicker and easier. / Well, I thought that since this church is so pretty on its own, why add too much to it? And Nick and I want the ceremony itself to be the centerpiece, not the decorations. / Where are the guys? I thought some of them were supposed to be helping us... / I set them to a task that will keep them out of our hair... / So now that we've run the ethernet, this machine will act as the central hub for all streaming audio and video to the Web. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051126.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051127.html
Well, that's most of the decorations. Anything that's left we'll handle after the rehearsal tomorrow. / Ooh! Ooh! Ki! / I know this is somewhat last minute, but can I be one of your bridesmaids? / Um, Persephone, usually it's the bride that asks, not the other way around. And I've already got three bridesmaids. / Sharon's my maid of honor, and Nicole and Nick's sister are the others. If we added you, the party would be uneven. / I thought Fred was going to be a groomsman... / I think Nick offered, but he wanted to maintain a low profile to avoid the paparazzi. / Then can I be the flower girl? / I'm sorry, but I've already asked Sydney to be our flower girl. / But... but I so much wanted to be a part of your wedding... / Perseffome can be my co-flower girl if she wants to! / Ooh! Can I? Can I? / Something tells me you should jump at this compromise. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051127.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051128.html
I guess that pretty much finishes things here tonight... / Um, not quite... / That was Lori on the phone. Someone stole her car today, so she can't drive in tonight. And since the airport there is closed while the runway is being repaired, she can't get a flight out. / She's trying to find out if there are any buses she can catch, but she isn't very hopeful. / Oh, no! This is terrible! What if she can't get here in time? / Where are we going to find a replacement bridesmaid this late? / Why have I suddenly developed an urge to flee in terror? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051128.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051129.html
Look, Ki, I'm very sorry, but I can't be a bridesmaid. It's a really long story, but I don't "do" weddings. I'll help set up and tear down, but I... I can't be here. Really. / Well, it looks like Persephone will get her chance... / I didn't want to hurt her feelings, but I don't think the molds would have worked in the party. I wanter her to stay with Sydney. / Then who in the world are you going to find at the last minute to fill in in case Lori doesn't make it? / Hello? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051129.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051130.html
Why, no, it's not a bad time! I just walked in the door. What can I do for you? / They stole her car? How terrible! Will she make it in in time for the wedding...? What are you going to do to find a replacement? / Oh, my! Ki, I'd be honored! Yes, I understand I'm a "fill-in." If Lori shows up, I'll step aside. Yes, I think I saw that gown at the shop. And I think they may even have it in my size. I'll check first thing in the morning. Right. See you there! / Too bad Lori's car is now at the bottom of a lake. I guess now she won't be needing these keys, poor dear... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051130.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051201.html
So when are you going to tell Nick that you just asked Trish to be Lori's replacement bridesmaid? / Um, well, the rehearsal's tomorrow... / Ki, you know Nick doesn't like or trust Trish! He's not going to like this... / I know, but who else are we going to ask? Mercedes de la Croix? One of the moms? / Nick will understand once I explain all the details. And just to be certain, I'll make sure he gets plenty of chocolate before I tell him. He's always easier to convince with a chocolate bribe. / I don't know... he likes chocolate more than any woman I know, but I think you'll need it extra dark this time... / Did someone say dark chocolate? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051201.html

Station, Gemini: Is the farmer in the dell? / A/V control center is online and ready to go! / Stations Posiedon: Does the River Styx flow onward ot Hades? / Aye, aye captain! We are live on the Web with broadband speed! / Station Gotham: Ever danced with the Devil by the pale moonlight? / Gigabit ethernet network is up and operating at peak efficiency. / You might want to tell Nick that his friend is going a little bit overboard. / Mayday! The fox is in the hen house! Mayday! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051202.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051203.html
So you see, we didn't have much of a choice. If Lori doesn't make it, Trish is the only girl available. Is that okay? / I don't know. I guess you did the right thing, but I'm not comfortable with her around. I think she's up to something... / Yeah, Justin. It's on. / Oh, come on. I know she's been weird, but she's no Trudy. It's not like she's plotting world domination... / You're luck this is bitter-sweet chocolate and not semi-sweet. I may need another bar before I'll let her into the rehearsal... / Later... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051203.html

We'd like to thank everyone for coming to our rehearsal dinner, and for sharing this happy occasion with us. / We're keeping things pretty informal, so grab a plate and dig in. Since Rev. Phisher has a prior engagement, we'll eat first, then meet him at the church for the rehearsal. / Let's eat, everybody! / A buffet-style dinner... different, but good idea, I think... / With this many varied tastes, it seemed appropriate. / A most bounteous feast, Mrs. Wellington. My deepest compliments. / Laying it on a bit thick, aren't we, Scott? / Mmm... Roasted chicken, ribs, salmon... where do i start? / Where areyou going to stop? Save some for the others. / There are even some moldy leftovers in the back for the molds. / We tried to think of everyone! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051204.html

I want to spread my unique brand of earthy wisdom, not squander my fifteen minutes on tack sensationalism. I... hold on a minute. / BZZT / Blast it!

When the Inventor's Gene strikes, I just build. I don't have time to take notes. / Ooh...

THAT DINNER WAS LOVELY! THE WELLINGTONS SURE PULLED OUT ALL THE STOPS, AND THE OSHIROS HAVE REALLY MADE THE CHURCH LOOK WONDERFUL. / HEY, ARE YOU OKAY? YOU'VE BEEN DISTRACTED ALL EVENING. / HUH? OH SORRY THE MASHED POTATOES AREN'T AGREEING WITH ME. / I DOUBT THAT, THIS IS ABOUT THAT CALL FROM YOUR BROTHER LAS NIGHT ISN'T IT? / OKAY, YEAH, BUT DON'T BRING IT UP IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS. / JUSTIN WANTED TO ALERT ME TO A, RECENT DEVELOPMENT WITH THE UGA, THAT'S WHY WE USED THE ENCRYPTION MATRIX, SOMETHING BIG HAS HAPPENED, AND HE WANTED ME TO KNOW BEFORE I HEARD FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. / THEY'RE... NOT ASKING YOU TO COME BACK, ARE THEY? / NO, BUT I'LL WANT TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HIM. THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE HUGE. / IT LOOKS LIKE SOME SKELETONS ARE COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET, AND NICK AND KI DO NOT NEED TO BE DEALING WITH THAT RIGHT NOW. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051211.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051212.html
KI: OKAY, EVERYONE WHO NEEDS TO BE HERE IS HERE, EXCEPT THE PASTOR. WE CAN GET STARTED SHORTLY. / NICK: WHERE'S TRISH? / KI: OVER THERE. FLIRTING WITH SCOTT INSTEAD OF YOU FOR A CHANGE. / NICK: GOOD. I WAS HOPING THAT SHE'D FINALLY BREAK ORBIT. / KI: SHE REALLY LATCHED ON TO YOU TONIGHT. OBVIOUSLY, OUR IMPENDING WEDDING ISN'T MUCH OF A DETERRENT. / NICK: ACTUALLY, ALL SHE'S TALKED ABOUT HAS BEEN MY INVENTIONS. / NICK: IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER, I'D SAY SHE'D RATHER HAVE SEX WITH MY MACHINES THAN ME. / KI: WELL, THEN THAT'S WHERE THE TWO OF US DIFFER. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051212.html

Okay, everyone. Rev. Phisher is here so let's get started! / All right, folks! Let's start with the procession. Ladies in the back, gents to the front. We'll start as the bridesmaids come down the aisle. / So, are you getting nervous yet, buddy? / Only that you'll end up losing or swallowing the rings for some bizarre reason. / Everything else is perfect. Just the way it should be. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051213.html

Nick: Sweetie, it's... it's okay. I... meant what I said. Nothing in your past could ever-- / Ki: It's... not that simple... / Ki narrating: We were almost to the point of... crossing the threshold when... / [[Ki sits up and covers herself with a blanket.]] / Ki: I-I'm sorry, Sam. I... I can't do this. / Sam: C'mon, baby. You're just nervous. Give yourself a bit more time to get into the moment and-- / Ki: No, Sam. I can't. I... just _can't_. / Ki narrating: Where things were blurred and uncerain before, now they were loud and clear, this wasn't right. I didn't know if it was me, or Sam, or just this moment, but it wasn't _right_. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051017.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051018.html
Ki: I'm sorry. I _wanted_ to, really. At least, _part_ of me did. But I think it was for all the wrong reasons. I just can't go through with it. / Ki: I love you. I really do. And I can't imagine giving myself to anyone else. But I made a promise to myself, and there's this alarm in my head going off. This isn't the way our first time should happen. / Ki: I hate the way everyone teases you, and I want to do _something_ to ease the stress you're under. I thought this was the way to do that, but I'm not ready for it. I'll do _anything_ for you, but not thise, not now. I hope you will understand... / [[He... didn't take it as well as I had hoped.]] http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051018.html

I told you I don't think-- / Sam: SHUT UP AND QUIT "THINKING!" / <> / Sam: If you're gonna @#*& start something, you better be @#*& sure you can finish it... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051019.html

[[Sam climbs on Ki in an attempt to rape her]] / Ki narrating: The blow stunned me. It took a moment to realize what was happening, and Sam seized that moment of weakness. / [[Ki struggles as Sam seizes her wrists]] / Ki narrating: I've always been fiercely independant, and part of that has been to compensate for my size. But deep inside I've always known that's mostly a facade. If it really came down to it, a woman like me could never hold up against a man like Sam. / [[Sam goes down on Ki]] / Ki narrating: He locked my wrists quickly, and the sheer weight of his huge body was enough to pin the rest of me. I struggled like an ant beneath a foot as he pinned my leg. / [[Ki knees Sam in the face]] / Ki narrating:Then I got lucky. He never did get that other leg pinned... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051020.html

[[Ki grabs a towel and runs out as Sam clutches his groin]] / Ki narrating: He was distracted just long enough for me to take aim at somewhere more delicate. That gave me my avenue for escape. / [[Ki runs down the hall]] / Ki narrating: I didn't bother with modesty. My goal was to run anywhere where I could find someone, anyone. Sam wouldn't dare hit me again in front of someone. / [[Ki runs down the hall, Sam is chasing her]] / Ki narrrating: I could hear his bare feet slapping the tile behind me. I knew he could catch me quickly, so I had to think of something fast. / [[Fooker opens his door]] / Ki narrating: Fortunately, I had a guardian angel just down the hall... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051021.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051022.html
[[Fooker lets Ki in just before Sam reaches her]] / Ki narrating: Fooker didn't ask questions. He didn't even make a snide remark. He simply let me in and quickly tried to shut the door. / [[Sam hits the door with his shoulder, forcing it open]] / Ki narrating: However, Sam had gathered enough momentum to bash the door before it was fully closed. He was furious, and wasn't about to let anything or anyone stop him. / [[Ki cowers while Fooker stands defiant]] / Ki narrating: I cowered behind Fooker. I didn't expect him to be more than a speed bump to Sam. After all, Fooker's far from being a formidable presence... / [[Sam throws a punch, but Fooker blocks it]] / Ki narrating: But I somehow suspect that, although I didn't know it at the time, Fooker was already moonlighting for the UGA at that point. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051022.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051023.html
[[Sam knocks Fooker's glasses off]] / Ki narrating: The two of them traded blows for several minutes. Fooker was quick and agile, but Sam was large and powerful. "David and Goliath" may have been too powerful a metaphor... / [[Sam is knocked to the ground as a result of Fooker's kick]] / Ki narrating: ... But the outcome was largely the same. / [[Sam staggers off]] / Ki narrating: By that point, the noise had attracted the attention of a few onlookers. Sam pulled a hasty strategic retreat. / [[Fooker holds out a shirt for Ki]] / Ki narrating: Fooker dispersed the crowd, got me a shirt to put on, and locked me in his room long enough to tell the RA what happened. / [[Fooker returns to his room as Ki sits on his bed]] / Ki narrating: After a few minutes, he came back. He asked if I wanted to call the campus police, and if I needed somewhere safe to stay. / [[Ki cries into Fooker's chest]] / Ki narrating: There was only one thing I needed at that moment, and he was more than happy to oblige me. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051023.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051024.html
Nick: Wow... I... never knew all this. Fooker never told me... / Ki: We have an understanding. He doesn't talk and I don't break his genitals. / Ki: On one hand, there's part of me that feels very sorry for Sam. I knew he was under tremendous pressure from every side, and I can see how what I did seemed like a big tease to him. I wasn't very fair to him. / Nick: Still, that doesn't excuse what he almost did to you... / Ki: No, it doesn't. And every time I lament about what I did to him, I remind myself of that. / Ki: And when I look at us and remember what my life was like with Sam, I realize just how special you are... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051024.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051025.html
Ki: I suppose I should go ahead and finish the rest of my story... / Nick: Although I have a good idea of what happens next... / [[Sam is holding a ring case and looking sad]] / Ki narrating: Sam tried to apologize. I'll give him credit for seeming sincere, but I warned him that he crossed a line that was extremely difficult and doubtful that I could ever forgive. I promptly returned the ring and we officially broke up. / [[Cheerleaders are talking behind Ki's back]] / Ki narrating: Rumors quickly flew around the school. Some had Sam cheating on me, others had me cheating on him (with Fooker!). I didn't care, and Sam never said anything either, mostly I think because he was embarassed that Fooker kicked his butt. / [[Fooker walks with Ki as they pass Sam, whose face has an expression of silent regret]] / Ki narrating: Fooker wouldn't let me walk alone for a long time. But Sam never bothered me again. Even if we passed in the hall, he'd say hello with a sad look on his face. I think he was genuinely sorry, but he knew he went too far. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051025.html

[[Ki's mother turns and looks at Ki's father, who is kicking a trash can]] / Ki narrating: Mom was very understanding about the breakup. Dad... wasn't. While I never told him exactly what happened, I think mom told him later. He broke a toe kicking a trash can and couldn't golf for weeks. / [[Ki's father's boss is holding out a paper to Ki's father in his office]] / Ki narrating: Remember that job Sam arranged for dad? Well, it wasn't long after the break-up that dad was fired for "improper use of company property," something about some equipment he swore his boss gave him permission to use. / {{Reference to the "unrelated reason" for Trish's firing- and an implication that Ki's father may have been correct?}} / [[Ki's father's silhouette ponders]] / Ki narrating: Dad quickly put two and two together, and it didn't matter if four was the outcome. He assumed that since his daughter's fiance didn't get what he wanted, daddy would make a good target for revenge. / [[Ki's father looks out a window]] / Ki narrating: There was never any proof to support his theory, of course, but that never stopped him. Dad was bitter in some ways before that, but this raised him to an all new level. Unfortunately, you got the brunt of his wrath. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051026.html

Ki: As for Sam, he didn't win the Heisman, but he did become a first round NFL draft. He's still playing for some team across the country, although his record isn't spectacular. / Ki: He ended up marrying Sandra, the matress with hair. Turns out all she wanted was his money, so they divorced a few years later. I don't keep tabs on him anymore, but I hope he succeeds at what he loves to do. / Nick: Thanks for sharing this with me, Ki. I know it was difficult, so I appreciate how hard it was to share. I hope you will never have to face that kind of situation again. / Ki: With you, I know I never will. / Nick: So now that that's done and over with, can we talk about our time traveling son from the alternate future? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051027.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051028.html
Ki: Y-YOU KNOW ABOUT TODD?! HOW?! / Nick: Relax! It's nothing to worry about. I know you didn't tell me about him to protect me. / Nick: After our first trek into the Mutex, I checked the internal logs to find out what went wrong. I saw the part where you were talking with a strange guy. Although part of it was garbled, I heard him call you "Mom." / Nick: After I found out the mutex could transport to alternate realities, I searched for one where he existed. In the few where I found him, he seemed to be a very brave, courageous young man. I only hope any son we have will be like him. / Ki: This log... did you keep a copy of it? / Nick: No. After I found out what Trent was up to, I "accidentally" deleted it in disgust. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051028.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051029.html
Ki: So, since you seem to be okay with the concept of Todd, can I see these alternate realities with him in them? / Nick: I don't think that's a good idea. / Nick: These alternate universes represent possible timelines, and knowing their outcomes could change our choices to certain events. Who knows how that could affect the flow of time & space. / Nick: I think we should meed Todd in our own special way. In a couple months, we'll be married. And when the time is right, we'll decide to have children. We don't *have* to name the first one Todd. But we can if you want to. / Ki: "The first one?" / Nick: Um, if we decide to have more. / Ki: And if the "first one's" a girl? / Nick: Er, Toddrica? / {{End}} http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20051029.html

With it, a hacker could theoretically control anything. Napier supposedly encoded this algorithm into the bones themselves, but only his own models, which he designed himself. / Harmony: The last known set of bones designed by Napier was recently removed from display for unspecified reasons. They were said to be stored in an unnamed vault in Groklots... / Harry: Which was recently emptied by Dexter then broken into. / [[Harry leans on the table where Harmony and Donald are sitting]] / Harmony: We don't know that. / Harry: But it makes sense. Dexter brought the bones here, and now you know who is coming to steal them. If he figures out the algorithm, he could take over the world... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080919.html

[[Harry, Harmony, and Donald focus on Harmony's laptop]] / Harmony: But how does Sysape fit into all this? / Donald: Duh. He's in league with you know who. He tries to off Harry, he's beating up Quux... / Harry: All this is speculation. We don't have any evidence to support that theory. Besides, if Dumpingcore had Dexter bring the bones here, he must have thought this was a safe place to keep them. / Harmony: But Sysape is on the faculty. Dumpingcore probably trusts him, which makes him a perfect mole. / Donald: Aye, he's even weaselly looking. / Harry: Still, we need to tell Dumpingcore directly. / [[Donald, Harmony, and Harry visit Prof McDongle (Patty) after changing clothes]] / Prof McDongle: Professor Dumpingcore?

[[Harry stands in front of Prof McDongle (Patty)]] / Harry: We have reason to believe that... someone is going to steal the Napier's Bones, professor. / Prof McDongle: How did you-- / [[Harmony speaks up]] / Harmony: We know all about the robot dog and the universal algorithm. We think someone is trying to help-- / Prof McDongle: I don't know how you three found out about all this... / [[Prof McDongle looks stern]] / Prof McDongle: But I can assure you that the Bones are perfectly safe. They are well guarded by traps and puzzles designed by several members of the faculty. Now I strongly advise you to return to your dorms before I'm forced to start handing out demerits. / [[Donald, Harmony, & Harry walk out of Prof McDongle's office]] / Harmony: She won't listen. Now what do we do? / Harry: We get to the Bones first. / Donald: I was afraid you'd say something like that... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080924.html

Is that the Napier's Bones? / Harmony: No, silly... / [[They stand in front of a wall of gears with two large, single-armed dials and a book on a pedestal in front of the wall]] / Harmony: It's a massive copy of the Antikythera Mechanism, one of the world's first mechanical computers. / [[Donald and Harmony face each other]] / Donald: And just how the bruisin' heck did you know that? / Harmony: Honestly.

[[Donald and Harry continue to stare at the wall as Harmony looks as the book on the pedestal]] / Harry: So what does this anti-kitten-hair thing do? / Harmony: The Antikythera Mechanism was a mechanical computer for computing astronomical positions. / [[Overhead shot of the three]] / Harmony: It was built before 100 BC and with a sophistication that wouldn't be seen again for a thousand years. Some say Hipparchus or even Archimedes had a hand in designing it. / [[All three now look at the book]] / Donald: What's this, then? / Harmony: It's binary, but it looks like ASCII. Should be easy enough to decode. I think it's a poem... / [[Close-up on Donald and Harmony]] / Harmony: "As Jupiter stood upon a ridge, his court sat down to a game of bridge. Mercury north and Venus south, Saturn east while Mars ran his mouth. O'er Saturn's shoulder Jove did thump and whispered to Vee, 'Sat's got the trump.'" / Donald: No, that's not confusing at all... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20081003.html

[[Harmony turns to Harry and Donald]] / Harmony: No, don't you get it? It's a puzzle! It's telling us how to position the planets on the Antikythera Mechanism! / [[Harmony starts diagramming the various planets]] / Harmony: First, we have to translate the names. We use Roman names for the planets, but Greeks built the machine. Next, the bridge positions tell us where to put the four "seated" gods, which leaves where to put Zeus... / [[Harry and Harmony face each other]] / Harry: To the lower right, where he could whisper to Aphrodite while peeking at Kronos' cards. / Harmony: Precisely! That gives us an exact date at which such an astronomical convergence would occur... / [[Donald points to a keypad by a door as Harmony blushes]] / Donald: Which I'll bet we enter into this keypad by this door!

We hunt the wumpus and shoot it, or it eats us if we fail. There are pits, too; that's the draft. We use our senses to figure out which way to go. / [[Donald leads the group as Harry and Harmony look at each other]] / Donald: Stick with me and I'll get us through. / Harry: Am I the only one who thinks it's suspicious that each of these tests is something one of us is good at? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20081013.html

So it's clear. That means... / Harmony: The wumpus is beyond that room, which was a pit! That's not fair! How do we defeat it if we fall in? / [[Donald walks to the exit and turns back]] / Donald: I'll go in and shoot the wumpus. Sure, I'll fall in, but it's the only way to win.

As Fooker would say, "We need to keep our cover stories straight". / Trudy: You're right. We need to coordinate. / Trudy: But we could have avoided this if you had told them SOMETHING.

Haven't they already asked? / Sharon: My parents don't pry into every little detail of my life. / Trudy: Maybe _those_ two don't. _Our_ parents will, and Mom at least won't be so easy to fool. / Trudy: She's crafty, manipulative, and has a photographic memory. She is unforgiving of failure or deceit. The second she suspects that our stories don't sync up, she'll prepare for attack. We may never get a second chance to reach her. / Trudy: If you're serious about finding her, we'll need to be on the same sentence, same paragraph, same page. / Sharon: _Now_ you're wanting to find her?

But that doesn't mean I can't find some way to _connect_ with them. / Trudy: You aren't looking to _connect_, Sharon. You want to _save_ them, to "turn them around". I'm telling you Mom doesn't _need_ or _want_ saving. She doesn't want either of us. She never did. We're better off without her, or dad for that matter. / Fooker: As much as I enjoy two hot chicks arguing, you might want to keep it down.

Don't want to say I told you so, but I warned you not to force the issue. / Fooker: We don't know her family history, but we know it's thorny for her. For that matter, we don't know _her_ history vs. _our_ Trudy's family ties. They could be totally different. Her parents could be saints where yours are twisted crooks. / Fooker: Then again, I'm not convinced she's ... What? / Sharon: "_Two_ hot chicks"? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090211.html

Ki grabbed me, the tide washed us in, I blacked out... / Ki: Ngh... / [[Ki sits up while Nick bends down and puts her hand on her back]] / Ki: I have a... sneaking suspicion we didn't drown... right? / Nick: Why do you say that? / Ki: If we were dead, I doubt I'd ache all over. / [[Ki looks around with Nick]] / Ki: So... where are we? / Nick: I came to just before you did, but a quick glance and a hunch says a deserted island. / [[Ki and Nick look at each other]] / Ki: And the inevitable '60s sit-com reference occurs in three, two... / Nick: You can be the movie star. I'll get started making a radio from coconuts. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080425.html

[[Nick and Ki have been washed up alone on an island beach. Ki is wearing an evening dress.]] / Nick: This end of the beach cuts off with these impassable rocks. / Ki: And the other end had those sheer cliffs. / Ki: So...How far do you think we've walked? / Nick: A couple of miles at least. If we can't follow the shore, I guess we should explore the interior. / Ki: A dense, foreboding jungle. Yes, sounds like a lovely romantic walk to me. / Nick: Right now, it's our only hope of finding out if this island is inhabited or deserted. / Ki: I hate to inform you, Indiana Jones, but neither of us are appropriately dressed for a jungle expedition. / Nick: Actually, for an Indiana Jones film, you'd be spot on. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080428.html

[[Ki and Nick standing on a beach in formal clothing]] / Ki: Before we go exploring, maybe our top priorities should be food & shelter. / Nick: Food doesn't look like a problem, if you don't mind fruit and fish. / [[Ki and Nick walking along the beach]] / Nick: As for shelter, I think I saw a cave back that way a bit, up that hill. / Ki: Cozy. Any ideas on how to get off this speck? Or should I start picking out curtains to match granite? / [[Nick looks at his PDA]] / Nick: Well, without the life boat, all we have is what's on our persons. My PDA is toast after that dunking, as is my cell phone, not that we'd get any signals anyway. So I guess the old standbys of sand carving and smoke signals will have to do. / [[Ki and Nick standing in place]] / Nick: At least our clothes, once dry, will keep us warm if the nights get cold... / Ki: I refer you back to my previous Indiana Jones wardrobe comment. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080430.html

[[Nick enters the mouth of a cave, looking into it, while Ki looks on from a distance]] / Nick: The cave looks empty from here, but we'll have to go in to be sure. / Ki: I'd much rather be certain no prior tenant will come back to evict us. / [[Nick, visible from the front, peers into the cave while Ki looks on]] / Nick: Pretty dark... don't happen to have a flashlight on you? / Ki: Gee, I left it in my other plunging mini-dress. / [[Nick's voice is heard off-panel while a shadowy figure emerges from the vegetation behind Ki]] / Nick's voice: Hold on... I think I see something. A glint of light, reflecting off something... could be metallic... / Ki: Metallic? Maybe it could be a radio or survival pack left by someone else... / [[Someone, possibly the man in the bushes, points a gun at a frightened Ki's head]] / Nick's voice: Um, I'll be sure to ask the nice gentleman with the gun if he'll let me... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080502.html

[[Ki and Nick cuffed in front of an armed soldier]] / Nick: So much for this island being deserted... / Ki: It's a good thing I didn't give into that urge to pounce you on the beach... / [[Soldier leaning into Nick]] / Soldier: Quiet, you two. Save your chatter for the boss' questions. / Nick: And who, pray tell, is "The Boss"? / [[Nick and Ki on a balcony looking down at a huge control center]] / Ki: I get the distinct impression he's not Bruce Springsteen... / Nick: Does any of this seem vaguely familiar to you...? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080505.html

[[Ki, Nick, and a soldier walking down a flight of stairs]] / Corporal: Found this pair near the cave entrance, sir. Looks like it was their boat that capsized on the reef. / Voice off-panel: Good work, corporal. / [[Ki and Nick facing someone off-panel]] / Voice off-panel: Although the restraints are unnecessary. These two are... old friends. They pose no threat. / Ki: It _/can't/_ be... / Nick: You've _/got/_ to be kidding... / [[Nick, Ki, and a man in the shadows]] / Man in shadows: Judging from your attire, it would be safe to assume you didn't come here willingly. I'd bet you washed overboard from that passing cruise ship. / Nick: That would be correct... / [[Close up of the mystery man]] / Nick (off-panel): Mr. Connery, or should I say, "Moldfinger"? / Moldfinger: Ah, it seems someone at the U.G.A. is getting lax with their memory wiping... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080507.html

[[Ki, Nick, and Mr. Connery talking]] / Connery: Let's see... "Alex Blighter" and "Pennymoney", wasn't it? Or should I just use your _/real/_ names, Mr. Wellington and Ms. Oshiro? / Ki: That's _/Mrs./_ Wellington. / [[Mr. Connery talking to Ki]] / Connery: Ah, congratulations, then. It seems my sources aren't as current as I had hoped. I _/try/_ to stay on top of things, but in today's fast-paced world, you know... / [[Nick talking to Mr. Connery]] / Nick: Look, Moldfinger, we don't want any trouble. We washed onto your beach by accident. We weren't looking for your secret lair... / Connery: Oh, I wouldn't call it a "secret lair". / [[Mr. Connery gestures to the entire complex]] / Connery: This is my little... retirement bungalow. / Ki: So bungalows come equipped with armed stormtroopers and dozens of satellite feeds these days? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080509.html

[[Ki, Nick and Connery talking]] / Connery: Ah... That sharp wit I've heard so much about. You should have taken up my offer so many years ago, Mrs. Wellington. / Ki: The answer's still no. / Connery: Pity. As to my little paradise, a man of my... status has high needs for security these days. Whether it's the paparazzi or covert government agents, privacy is a hard thing to come by. / Nick: So... you really are retired? / Connery: From both filmmaking and plotting world domination. All I want now is peace and quiet... with no one looking over my shoulder. / Nick: I heard you secretly hate Shia Labeouf. / Connery: If Spielberg and Lucas sent you, for the last time the answer is a resounding no. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080512.html

[[Ki, Nick and Connery talking]] / Connery: No matter. You are free to go. In fact, you may stay at my private villa on the other side of the volcano for the next few days, to finish out what seems to be your honeymoon. Meals and services are on the house. / Ki: You're... not going to kill us? We could expose your hiding place to the U.G.A. / Connery: Kill you? I told you. I'm retired. My evil mastermind days are over. / Connery: And once you leave, this island will be destroyed, along with all traces of where I'll go next. So tell the U.G.A. all you want. It will make little difference. / Connery: In fact, my men will take you back to civilization on one condition: you must deliver a message to our dear mutual friend, Mr. James Baud... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080514.html

Moldfinger: C.R.U.D.E., the evil organization to which I once pledged my allegiance, is dead. Nefarious, Not, Inertia and most of the support staff are behind bars. I, as previously stated, am retired and seek no further quarrel. / Moldfinger: Despite this, there is a new and growing threat, one I have heard whispers of through my many contacts. The U.G.A. would be wise to be prepared for the inevitable. / Moldfinger: Tell Mr. Baud to beware the Colonel and the Key Master. Beyond this, I have nothing else useful to share. Oh, other than to say that Inertia is not everything he appears. / Moldfinger: With that, I bid you adieu. I hope you enjoy your stay. My congratulations again to the happy couple. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080516.html

[[Outside Antony's Pizzeria]] / Voice 1: You mean you two really stayed there another three days? / Voice 2: Well, the chef made a really good filet mignon... / [[Fooker, Sharon, Ki, & Nick sitting at a table inside of Antony's Pizzeria]] / Sharon: Still, I think I would have been creeped out, knowing I was sleeping in an evil mastermind's bed. / Ki: Well, now he's got quite a show to watch on his CCTV. / [[Closeup of Fooker & Nick]] / Nick: So... Any idea about this "Colonel" and "Key Master"? / Fooker: Aside from calling Bill Murray about the "Gate Keeper", not a clue. / [[Closeup of Fooker & Nick]] / Nick: The way he said it seemed to imply you'd know who he meant. / Fooker: Maybe...

I'll bet you guys picked up a few new tricks. / Nick: I'd say we learned a few useful... techniques. / [[Sharon gives Fooker a nasty look]] / Fooker: Any new interfaces you'd like to share? Exciting methods of input and output? Data streaming into open sockets? Tunneling pipes? Dumping core? / [[Nick and Ki leave, while Sharon is still glaring at Fooker]] / Sharon: You're making obscure computer sex jokes, aren't you? / Ki: It's okay, Sharon.

[[Justin on the phone in a UGA office]] / Justin: Hello? Hi, Jas. Yeah, line's secure. Got your message, just haven't had time to follow up yet. / [[Justin walking down a corridor]] / Justin: Yeah, no clue here either. Neither are aliases currently in use that I'm aware of. We put a flag in all the systems, so if those keywords crop up, we'll know. / [[Justin looking through glass]] / Justin: Oh, him? No change. He just sits there. Barely eats, barely moves. No clue how he sustains all that bulk while eating like a bird. It's like he's waiting for something, but we have no clue what that could be. / [[Justin looking in on Mr. Inertia in a yoga pose]] / Justin: Don't worry, if anything changes, you'll be one of the first to know... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080523.html

[[A sidewalk cafe, a helicopter shot]] / Sharon: I love this little corner Bistro. It's open and sunny, within walking distance of the office and the food is awesome... / Dexter: Amen to that part. / [[The scene zooms in and we see Dexter, Sharon and Nick seated at the table. Nick is preoccupied by his PDA]] / Dexter: So when will Fooker and Ki get back from Springfield? / Sharon: Probably around Five. That customer insisted on an on-site demo of our new custom CMS. / Sharon: Nick... you haven't put your PDA down since we got here. Don't you *ever* unplug once in a while? / Nick: Sharon, this isn't just a PDA. It's my external brain. I can barely function without it. / Sharon: I hope Ki knew when she married you that she had competition for your affections... / Nick: Actually, she *loves* when I use this thing... / PDA: ALERT: ANNIVERSARY OF FIRST KISS TOMORROW http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080526.html

[[Dexter, Nick, and Sharon at a local restaurant]] / Nick: My PDA is my lifeline. Without it, I'm useless. It has my schedule, my contacts, tons of little notes, my encrypted password database... It's my neural core dump. / [[Dexter hits his glass]] / Nick: It's essential to my daily operations. I'm incomplete without it. / Sharon: And Dexter just spilled soda all over it. / Dexter: Huh? / [[Dexter bobbles the PDA]] / Dexter: Omigosh! Sorry, Nick! / Nick: It's okay, Dex. I've done worse.

Sorry. / [[Fooker raises his index finger while speaking to Ki while Sharon looks on]] / Fooker: You know, early-morning nookie is not an acceptable excuse for missing one of Dwayne's status meetings. / Ki: FYI, Nick used to use his PDA as an alarm clock. We forgot to find a substitute. / [[Ki continues talking with Fooker and Sharon]] / Sharon: Still haven't found a replacement yet? / Ki: With this project deadline, we haven't had a chance to go shopping. We'll hit the stores this weekend. / Fooker: How's he holding up? / [[Ki and Fooker's silhouettes, standing in the door frame, look at Nick, who has disheveled hair, a slightly loose tie and a not completely tucked shirt.]] / Ki: It's... not pretty. / Nick thinks: Did I remember to put on underwear this morning? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080602.html

[[Dexter enters Nick's office where Nick, looking disheveled, is at work at his computer.]] / Dexter: I'm really sorry about your PDA, Nick... / Nick: It's okay, Dexter. Accidents happen. It was getting old anyway. / Dexter: Ya know, maybe you should look into a smartphone. It's one less device to carry... / Nick: Eh. "Converged" devices are usually only good at one thing or the other, or worse, neither. / Dexter: That may have been true a few years ago, but they're a lot better now. I love my Blackberry, and it does everything I need. / Nick: Hrm. My phone is rather utilitarian... / Nick: At this point, I just need something. I'm barely able to function today... / Dexter: Did you know you've compiled that same module three times while I've stood here? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080604.html

Before long you'll need to find an alternative and... Nick? / [[Nick is pressed up against the glass of an Apple store window looking at an iPhone display.]] / Ki: You're in PDA Nirvana right now, aren't you? / Nick: We wants it, my precious. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080606.html

[[Ki and Nick are in an Apple store as Nick plays with an iPhone.]] / Ki: An iPhone? I didn't think you'd go for an Apple product... / Nick: It's not PalmOS, but it's not Windows Mobile either... / Nick: It is a pretty sweet little machine. It's sleek, snappy... / [[Ki takes out a calculator]] / Ki: Yeah, but we're still paying for two honeymoons. I want to run the numbers. / Ki: The required data plan puts us paying 25% more per month. We'd also have to buy the phone itself. For that matter, I'd need a new phone, and that's not even getting to the fee for breaking our current contract... / Ki: We're looking at a good $900 more over two years than if you just got that Treo from our carrier... / Nick: Heh... multi-touch.

[[Ki and Nick are walking out of an Apple store]] / Ki: I'm sorry I burst your geeky bubble... / Nick: No, deep down I knew it needed to be burst. / Nick: Technically, we're a two-income family now, we can afford the premium. But we can also take the more financially frugal path and put that grand every two years to better use. / Nick: Plus, I've got a ton of Palm software I've collected over the years that will still work with the Treo. With the iPhone, I'd have zip... unless I hacked it and risked bricking it. For me, this is a wiser choice. / Ki: But the tremble in your voice is lusting for that smooth, black glass finish... / Nick: Excuse me...

[[Sharon and Ki are at the coffee machine.]] / Sharon: So Nick gave up an iPhone for a more affordable Treo? / Ki: He may be a geek, but he's a responsible geek. / Sharon: Wow. I don't think Fooker could be that thrifty. Not that he'd buy a gadget with a proprietary OS. / Ki: I've seen Fooker with a credit card. Trust me, I know. / [[They walk past Nick's office where Nick is on the phone.]] / Ki: Still, Nick will get his smartphone in a couple days and all will return to normal. / Nick: Supermegaship? Yes, I'm trying to track a shipment... / Sharon: Since when has "normal" been a word used to describe this place? / Nick: What do you mean, you LOST IT?! http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080613.html

Patty: Morning, Dexter. Did you have a good weekend? / Dexter: Hey, Patty. Not bad. I reorganized my Star Wars action figures alphabetically. / Patty: Um, right. Look, as soon as you're logged in, I need you to review Ki's table layout for the Grossman database. I think we need a few more columns and... Hey, what's that? / Dexter: Hm? / Dexter: What's a limo doing outside? Is Dwayne meeting some big shot? / Patty: Not that I know of. Wait... are they caterers? What's with the lime gelatin mold? / Dexter: That's... not gelatin. That's a slime mold. / Patty: Ah.

I always have time for my employees. / Dwayne: Who is this? / Fred: Oh, this is Klaus, my bodyguard. Don't mind him, but I wouldn't advise any sudden moves. / Dwayne: O....kay. / Fred: Dwayne, you've been very good to me, giving me a job when the university dumped me, standing by me through the Trent fiasco... I really appreciate all you've done, but let's face it. I'm not cut out for phone tech support. / [[Klaus scowling]] / Dwayne: Are you... quitting? / Klaus: I don't like his tone of voice, boss... / Fred: Easy, big guy.

[[Fred and Dwayne talking]] / Dwayne: I suppose it's not that big of a surprise. With your "outing" in the wake of the trial, you've been in high demand. / Fred: Tell me about it. / [[Fred gesturing]] / Fred: It wouldn't be fair to either of us for me to stay. I'm constantly distracted by bookings and appearances. I can't do my phone gig for you if I'm in LA doing an interview, and I can't do the celeb thing tied to a phone and keyboard. / [[Fred and Dwayne shake hands]] / Dwayne: Well, I can't say I'm not disappointed, and I hate to see you go. However, I understand your decision and I wish you the best of luck. / Fred: If you ever need a celebrity endorsement, just let me know. / [[Bodyguard holds Dwayne back]] / Bodyguard: Sir, I must ask you to back away from the mold... now... / Fred: Klaus, he's clean.

Sharon: So what do you guys think of Fred's decision to quit GPF? / Nick: I'm on the fence. I'm happy he's doing so well, but afraid it's going to his... um... nucleus. / Nick: It seems to me most of his celebrity is based on the novelty of his uniqueness. Once the media has had its fill of him, I think he'll get dumped onto the D-List with former child actors and American Idol rejects. / Ki: How is Fooker taking the attention focused on his apartment? / Sharon: He's been cool to the molds lately, ever since we got back from the alternate universe. And he won't say why. / Nick: Oh, I'm sure they had a disagreement that will work itself out in a day or two. / Fred: Smell you later, chump. / Fooker: Good riddance. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080623.html

Even got some favors in with the health inspector to keep it favorable to our unique needs. I've been humming "The Jeffersons" theme all day. / [[Fred, Persephone, Ki, & Nick]] / Persephone: I'm really going to miss this place, Fred. And Fooker. Without him, we'd literally be nothing. / Fred: He's been holding us back, Persephone. He no longer needs us and vice versa. / [[Persephone, Fred, and Ki]] / Ki: Are you sure you can afford this? That sounds expensive... / Fred: I'm booked solid for the next six months. This is pocket change. I need the bling. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080625.html

Ki: Wow...I can't believe you and Fred are parting ways... / Fooker: If you ask me, it's been too long coming. / Nick: This is a pretty big turnaround. You two have been inseparable for so many years. / Fooker: Well, people change. _/Fred/_ sure has. / Sharon: There's more to this parting than Fred's ego. _/You've/_ been treating the molds differently ever since we got back from the alternate universe. What happened there to start this? / Fooker: Sometimes you learn things about someone you know that totally changes your perception of them.

I need geek help. I'm installing a server cluster and T-1 line to host my new multimedia hub. I thought I'd ask my favorite techies who bathe to come by and help. / [[Ki, Nick, and Fred talking]] / Nick: Sure thing. Just show me where it is and I'll get started. / Fred: No, no. Ki can handle that. I need you for something more important. / Ki: Wait... Was I just complimented or insulted here? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080630.html

Nick: What could be more important then setting up your servers? / Fred: I could argue lots of things, but these were what I referred to. / Fred: These are scripts my agent sent me. Ever since I started the talk show circuit, the offers for guest stints and cameos have flooded in. I need to sort through them to decide which to take. / Nick: TV scripts? Why would you want *my* help? / Fred: This seemed right up your alley... / Nick: Russell T. Davies... / Nick: OMIGOSH!

[[Ki working on cables while Fred and Nick talk about the advanced Doctor Who script]] / Fred: So I'm supposed to be some sort of galactic jellyfish? / Nick: Not exactly. I think of Rutans as single cells of a massive, distributed multi-cellular organism. / [[Nick and Fred continue to talk]] / Fred: I guess I can see the typecasting as irony. So these solarans-- / Nick: Sontarans. / Fred: Whatever. Mister Potato Head here tries to zap me with his magic wand... / Nick: The Sontaran "wand" is actually a very sophisticated weapon. It can stun, hypnotize, and cut through materials as well as kill. / Fred: Yeah, yeah. So we've been at war for a couple centuries... / Nick: Actually, most fans agree that references in the show indicate the Rutan/Sontaran war lasts at least 70,000 years, and that-- / Fred: You're dangerously close to displacing Dexter as king of the nerds, Nick. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20080704.html

That shouldn't take long; Nick and Ki are bound to be home by now... / [[Ki puts down her purse and Nick takes off his jacket as they both just walk into their apartment]] / Nick: Honey, was I running an experiment on the MUTEX? / Ki: You usually are... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090306.html

[[Nick is puzzled as he looks at the MUTEX]] / Nick: It's funny... I think the MUTEX has been running since we got back after Christmas, but I don't recall kicking off a job before we left. I just assumed I had... / Ki: (off-panel) Nick... / [[Ki holds up some chips]] / Ki: You went to the grocery story yesterday, right? Why did you pick up a bag of Cheddar Chunks? Neither of us like them all that much. / Nick: I didn't. / [[Nick looks in the fridge as Ki notices something off-panel]] / Nick: That's funny. Neither of us drink Blue Steer either, but there's a whole pack in the fridge. How'd that get in there? / Ki: I think I know... / [[Ki holds up an over-sized jacket]] / Ki & Nick: (together) Dexter. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090309.html

[[Nick and Ki's apartment]] / Ki: Found two more coats, a man's and a woman's. / Nick: That would be Tim and Patty, alright. / Ki: That explains the extra food, the coats, why some lights were on when we got back... But what were they doing here? / Nick: I think the three of them came over and Dex used your key to get in. Then they tried to use the MUTEX to play "Bog of Bloodbath" as a virtual world but got stuck inside because Dex forgot to bring the master remote. / Ki: How did you come up with that theory? / [[Nick holds some optical disks and a remote]] / Nick: Dexter. Game discs. Remote. Elementary, dear Watson. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090311.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090313.html
[[Nick and Ki's apartment.]] / Ki: So now what? Can you get them back out? / Nick: On that I'm not so sure. / Nick: The MMORPG interface for the MUTEX was very alpha code. I hadn't tested it before we left, so in one sense I'm surprised it worked at all. / Ki: You mean the MUTEX actually has beta code? / Nick: The point is that no one has ever gone into the MUTEX without a controller on the outside. No one could pull me back from the alternate universe because they had no frame of reference to find me. / Nick: With no idea where in the "BoB" they are, our friends may be trapped in there forever... or at least until the company shuts down the servers... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090313.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090316.html
[[Ki and Nick sit in front of the MUTEX]] / Ki: Then what's the plan? / Nick: First we try to track them down. For that, Wireshark is our friend. / Nick: If I sniff the packets coming and going over the cable modem, I can isolate the IP of the remote machine and figure out which game server they're on. That, at least, should narrow down the search to a single game world. / [[Nick looks back at Ki]] / Nick: From there, one of us will have to go in after them while the other monitors everything from here. It will be a manual search unless I can find some way in game to locate them. / [[Nick turns back to the computer as Ki cracks her knuckles]] / Nick: And since you don't have any experience running the MUTEX... / Ki: Just call me Kithinera the Elven Ranger... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090316.html

Is everything OK? / [[Ki looks down at her revealing female elven outfit]] / Ki: I'm fine, but we need to talk to my tailor. Any chance I can bring this back with me? I think you'll like it. Lots of... open access. / Nick: (off-panel) I'll... see what I can do. / [[Ki looks toward the sun on the horizon]] / Nick: (off-panel) I can confirm that this is where they "spawned", but unfortunately they could have gone anywhere from here. You'll need to track them down on your own. / Ki: And just how am I supposed to do that? / [[Ki kneels and sees footprints in the grass]] / Nick: (off-panel) You're a ranger, remember? Use your skills. I artificially inflated your level to give you better odds. / Ki: Did I mention that I love you? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090318.html

[[Ki's character walks along in the world of Bog of Bloodbath]] / Ki: If you can bump up my level, how about rustling up a horse or something? / Nick: (off-panel) Sorry, rangers can't use mounts in this game. / Ki: Figures. / [[Ki continues to walk]] / Ki: Nick, I'm only guessing this is the right path. There were dozens of tracks out of that Girmwald place. This looks like the same set of footprints but I can't be sure. / Nick: (off-panel) Oh, you've got them alright. / [[Nick is sitting at the computer terminal of the MUTEX]] / Nick: I've been watching the packets and managed to crack some of the game logic. I think I can pinpoint you and every other player on the map. You're making great speed and you'll catch up to them soon. / [[Ki tilts her head in the game]] / Ki: How can you be sure? / Nick: (off-panel) Because there's only five players on the server, and I've got a hunch #5 isn't playing fair... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090320.html

[[Ki's character continues to walk in the world of Bog of Bloodbath]] / Ki: Only five players? And you think the odd man is a hacker? / Nick: (off-panel) Looks like it. It could explain a few things. / [[Nick works at his computer]] / Nick: I'm now analyzing the game server's traffic. It looks like hundreds of login requests are getting bounced. None of the other servers seem to have this problem. And only two IPs are making valid connections. / [[Ki's character has mountains in the background]] / Ki: One of those is us, including our friends. What makes you think the other IP is a hacker? / Nick: (off-panel) The traffic pattern doesn't match any of ours, and we've got four legit players. / [[Nick is intense in his concentration]] / Nick: There's a whole stream of encrypted sub-packets embedded in his connection. I'm going to capture a few and see what I can decipher. / Ki: (off-panel) Glad I can be a big help... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090323.html

[[Nick is in silhouette in front of his computer and 3 monitors]] / Nick: Actually, you're giving me tons of valuable data. Using your traffic as an example, I'm certain I know who's who. Now I just need to ID #5. / [[Ki's character in Bog of Bloodbath looks back at a dragon corpse]] / Ki: Why don't you just ping flood him and knock him offline? / Nick: (off-panel) It's too risky. / [[Nick in profile at his computer]] / Nick: All the old MUTEX dangers still apply. If the connection gets severed, you and the others are toast. And something tells me that severing his connection might bring down the server. I can't risk that. / [[Ki looks forward at another slain dragon]] / Ki: I'd appreciate that. / Nick: (off-panel) You should be getting close. / Ki: Another dragon corpse. At least that's better than Dex's orc droppings. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090325.html

The U.G.A. treats us extremely well. / Nefarious: _You_ seem to have adjusted well to domestication, Alexis, but not _me_. No prison can hold Dr. Nefarious for long!

I am appalled! / Doctor Not: Please, Nathaniel. We made our bid for world domination and were beaten fair and square. We ran and were caught. It's time we paid the piper, as it were. Devil's due and all. / Nefarious: Easy for you to say, Little Miss Traitor. I've _seen_ you getting all buddy with agent #12. All that "girl talk" ... You _know_ she's plumbing you for information. You've been incriminating all of us for what? Your designer pink "prison uniform"? / Not: For the record, it's "sorbet", not pink. And #12 has the best gossip on your favorite agent, James Baud. / Nefarious: Such as? / Not" He's not James Baud. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090403.html

Doctor Nefarious: Whaddaya mean, "He's _not_ James Baud"? / Doctor Not: The Agent #6 currently employed by the U.G.A. isn't the one who caught us. He's his brother. / Not: It seems our old nemesis has retired and passed on the "mantle" of Baud to his sibling. The resemblance is uncanny, but _surely_ you've noticed he's changed more than his hair. / Nefarious: Well, I _assumed_ he had some work done. / Not: Speaking of retirement, Maddie tells me Moldfinger has hung up his toupee as well, quietly disappearing to a private island somewhere. / Nefarious: Ol' Penicillin Pinkie has _quit_?

Well, then... What's the scuttlebutt on the rest of C.R.U.D.E.? Surely we aren't the only ones in custody. / Interesting you should ask... / Capt. Calamity and Lady Ruin were both killed by agents in 2004. The Damnation Trio botched a teleportation experiment while trying to escape Agent #18 in 2005. Only to end up in six separate locations. / Ew. I don't like that math. / Lord Kamatayan and Duchess Lebeti ran off together on a whirlwind tryst of lust and larceny only to end up killing each other over their spoils in 2007. / Dang. Lebeti wasn't much to look at, but she could sure incite panic. / The most bizarre is Stratego. Maddie says she's now fighting alien invaders in a parallel universe. / That's it! My escape plan!

[[Dr. Nefarious and Dr. Not sitting in prison]] / Dr. Not: Before you plan your cosmic trip, you might want to hear about Inertia. Maddie says he's locked up in here, with us. / Dr. Nefarious: Here? I haven't seen him. / [[Close-up of Not's face with a sly look on her face]] / Dr. Not: That's because they keep him in the deepest, most secure cell in the place. He's in isolation and under constant guard. They know once he breaks loose, there's no stopping him. / [[Pan out to Nefarious and Not pondering why Inertia hasn't tried to escape]] / Dr. Nefarious: That brings up a good point. Inertia could break out any time he wanted. / Dr. Not: If he wanted to. Which brings the question: what is he waiting for? / [[Pan out again to Nefarious and Not in prison overalls, amid other prisoners]] / Dr. Nefarious: Somehow I doubt it's a chance to take us with him. / Dr. Not: After how you cheated him at go in 1999, it wouldn't surprise me... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090410.html

Give them something to talk about and they'll keep talking. / Agent #18: Then tell them about the weather. / Agent #6: Maddie's right. Spilling those secrets was worth the risk. They may know more than we'd like on a few things, but _we've_ learned just as much from them. / Agent #18: And just what _have_ we learned? / Agent #6: All told, they know just as little about Inertia as we do. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090413.html

Agent #18: Are you still hung up on Inertia? He's big, ugly, Asian, and mute. That's all _anyone's_ been able to learn. / Agent #12: Precisely his point. / Agent #12: He's been in our custody how many years now? And has he said a single word to _anyone_? We've stepped up security around him dozens of times, but no one thinks we can really strop him if he tried to escape. There are too many unanswered questions surrounding him. / Justin: He eats hardly anything and produces even less waste. All our medical tests have to be passive because no needles break his skin and he won't respond to queries. If he didn't breathe or have a pulse, we'd declare him dead. / Agent #18: Then load up a dump truck and bury him. I doubt anyone would know the difference. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090415.html

Justin: Sigh... Am I REALLY putting too much time into this? / Maddie: Well, you HAVE been a little obsessed. / Justin: I'm sorry, Maddie. I never meant to ignore other cases... or YOU. It's just... There's something about Inertia that's really bothering me. There are too many questions and not enough answers. / Maddie: You're not the first Barker I've known to get caught up in his work. That dedication is a trait I've admired in both of you. Just don't let it rule your life.[[kisses him]] / Justin: [[to himself, as she walks away]] I'll try, but somehow I fear this will become bigger than any of us could possibly imagine... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090417.html

And you can bet the no-PVP flag isn't going to stop anything now... / Droid: Whistle! / Scott: This level of sophistication requires serious skill. This guy's GOOD.

That he defeated the original hacker is no surprise. And the first, Knuth? / Knuth: He's good at tunneling lots of Tor use, SSH redirects... but I think I tracked him to a cable modem out west. I'm cracking his ISP's database to get a name and address now. / Zero One: Excellent. / Man 2: What do you intend to do, Zero One? / Zero One: An old saying goes "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer." I'm going to invite him to join us. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090603.html

Brother Knuth: Are you *serious*, Greg? Invite him into the brotherhood? / Greg (0 1): Yes. Inform our brothers in his area to prepare the test. / Greg (0 1): This hacker is one of unusual skill. Perhaps we can convert him... Or at least *control* him. Who knows... Scott *thinks* his heretics have found "The One". Maybe he's looking in the wrong place... / [[The following day.. An open box. Yoshi reads from a card in it.]] / Yoshi: "The test has begun. You have twelve hours. Failure is not an option." / [[Yoshi picks up the card and examines it more closely]] / Yoshi: What the fork? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090605.html

Nick: Finally retiring after all these years, Uncle Wise? / Wisebottom: Ah, Nicholas! Thanks for your assistance. / Wisebottom: I apologize for the mess. I just finished sorting out my personal stuff to load into the truck. / Ki: And which pile of mad science refuse is that? / Wisebottom: The one by the door. Fortunately, by Tesla, I'm going to miss this place. So many memories, so many inventions... / Nick: So many disintegrations... / Ki: And just what will you do with yourself now that you have unlimited free time? Surely not take up fishing...? / Wisebottom: Oh, but of course! But only with my laser-guided, sonic powered, rail-gun style harpoon rod. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090608.html
 
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090610.html
Ki: So where are you off to? / Wisebottom: New Mexico. I spent some time there as a lad while my dad worked for the Army. / Ki: You know, I've never heard much about your past, Otto. And someone hasn't bothered to share. / Wisebottom: Oh, it's not that interesting. Mom was a homemaker, dad a rocket scientist... / Ki: A rocket scientist? I never would have guessed... / Wisebottom: No need for sarcasm, my dear. You know full well that he too carried the inventor's gene. Although it only manifested as mere brilliance, not genius. / Ki: Modesty and humility must be recessive traits on the same chromosome, I suppose. / Wisebottom: Those traits do tend to be mutually exclusive, don't they? http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090610.html

Uncle Wise [[picking up a box of Doodads & Whatsits]]: Retirement makes you reflect on a lot of things. Things former, things present... You kids should think about your future. One day you will find there are a lot fewer tomorrows than you previously anticipated. / Nick [[hauling a box of unidentified gizmos]]: This is from a man who invented a time machine... / Uncle Wise: I'm aware of the irony. / Ki [[Picking up a box of gadgets]]: Whatever became of that thing? You said you were going to dismantle it. / Uncle Wise: I DID. But I found I could never DESTROY it. It's packed up and ready to ship to New Mexico. / Uncle Wise: After hearing about your time traveling offspring, I couldn't bring myself to destroy it. Once YOU figure out the temporal logic surrounding whether or not its destruction will alter past AND future events, THEN I'll sleep better at night. / Ki [[blushes]] http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090612.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090615.html
Wisebottom: I've thought about that a lot, you know what would happen if I complete destroyed the time machine. Would that change anything that may or may not have happened? / Wisebottom: Nick was right. Man was not meant to delve into such things. We are creatures that exist in four dimensions. We naturally alter our own future; but to alter one's own past is an entirely different matter. / Ki: Otto, you can't keep second guessing yourself. Leave it disassembled but intact. If Todd really needs it some day, he'll find it eventually. / Wisebottom: I suppose you're right my dear. / Wisebottom: And to think I may never have gotten it to work if those girls hadn't shown me how to do it. http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090615.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090617.html
Nick: What do you mean, "If those girls hadn't shown me how to do it?" / Wisebottom: What? Oh, THAT? Um, nothing. Forget it said it. / Nick: Hold on now. You told us YOU invented the time machine. Are you saying you DIDN'T? / Wisebottom: No! Of COURSE I did! I just needed to see another working model. / Nick/Ki: Another working model?!? / Wisebottom: I KNEW I shouldn't have said that... / Wisebottom: Perhaps... there are a few things I've neglected to tell you over the years... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090617.html
http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090619.html
Otto: I didn't tell you, mostly because I still barely believe the tale myself. Yet it happened, and you might as well hear the entire thing. / Otto: Mind you, I don't know completely how it began, and frankly I have no idea how their story came to an end. But there was I, a young pup in my teens, thrust into a serial far stranger than any you'd catch at the matinee. / Otto: For me, the story begins in the spring of 1948. But for them I suppose it began in Nazi-occupied Austria of 1945. Well... Actually, I suppose it really began in 2002 in New York, if what they said was true... / Otto: Let me start again. In Austria, 1945 two women from 2002 were seeking to return to their own time, in hopes of saving Mrs. Von Schnagel's husband, whom they just left (again) in 1945... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/20090619.html

Above the gate, in large block letters, is the name NERDVANA, with a sign just underneath reading "THE GEEKIEST PLACE ON EARTH". Below, a display reads "Over 3,004,763.9834617 served". Left of the NERDVANA sign is an anthropomorphic robot standing with legs and arms spread, that appears to welcome the visitors. On the other side of the sign is a satellite, solar panels deployed. / Above the curtain wall, we see parts of some of the rides: a stick and ball model of a molecule, a mock-up of a USA space program rocket with 4 stubby aircraft attached to it by rods (possibly part of a merry-go-round), a model the Enterprise from The Original Series, and the head and shoulders of a bipedal dinosaur. / On the wall itself are posters for some of the rides: DEV/NULL (unidentifiable drawing on poster), CHEMISTS' LAGOON (drawing on poster may be a 3-eyed fish), and NULL POINTER (unidentifiable drawing on poster). / Among the people waiting outside the Nerdvana entrance gate are: Lev Babiev from Babiev & Campling's Hosers; Miranda, Mike, and Greg from Illiad's User Friendly; Mayberry Melonpool from Steve Troop's Melonpool; ???; Roger Pepitone from Maritza Campos-Rebolledo's College Roomies From Hell; and Torg and Riff from Pete Abram's Sluggy Freelance. / Nick, Ki, and Fooker are next to Lev Babiev, Ki sporting a wide goofy (or perhaps dreamy) smile.]] / Nick: I wonder if this is the right place... http://www.gpf-comics.com/d/19990913.html
