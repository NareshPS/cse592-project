First, you weren't so hot those days. After Dundun you went into a coma for a whole week, and couldn't see for some days after that. / Dave: Okay. can I start freaking out right now? / Roger: Yeah, I know... and when you found out about the deal we made with Damascus, you got really angry. / Dave: I can see that.

So let's take a VOTE. Mike? / Mike: Um... sorry, guy. The political situation is pretty delicate, and this is not a good time for dissidence. If you want, you can be a satellite member.

You're not serious! / Marsha: I am. And it was Mike's idea. / Dave: How could he put that on your shoulders??? Why are you still with him? / Marsha: Oh, I know what he was doing. He figured I wouldn't kill April now that he was alive. Here. / [[Marsha hands Dave the ice pack.]] / Dave: So he manipulated you into forgiving April??? Wow, what a scumbag. / [[Dave puts the ice pack on his ankle.]] / Marsha: [[off-panel]] Yeah, I know. But it was better in the end. I really never wanted April dead, at least not while I was in my right mind. / Marsha: [[off-panel]] Still, I was pretty angry about it all. Depressed. But I got over it. / Dave: I seriously wish I could do that. / Marsha: [[off-panel]] I didn't do it alone. Someone helped. / Dave: Oh, yeah? Who is this wonder guy? Maybe I can do his laundry? / Marsha: Well, he told me that being angry wasn't a really good reason for doing anything. / Marsha: And that I had a choice. I could let the bad things go, or I could let them become my roommates. / Marsha: And then he gave me a kitten. / [[Marsha smiles at Dave.]] http://crfh.net/d/20090928.html

[[Mike has returned with sodas, and is now sitting at the kitchen table with Dave.]] / Mike: So did you take a deep breath and counted to a zillion or do I drive you home while playing the radio really loud? / Dave: No... okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. I had a talk with Marsha. / Mike: Oh, did you? Uuh... about what? / Dave: Stuff. But it made me realize things. Like the fact that yeah, apparently I'm very happy with the current situation. / Mike: That's what everybody keeps telling you, man. Why don't you trust us for once and let it go? / [[Dave opens his soda.]] / <> / Dave: That would just be the easiest thing to do, right? *SIGH* / Dave: Look, I know you owe me nothing. But, I've been thinking. I need your help. / Dave: I want back into NOES. And I want my lasers back. / Dave: I'm gonna have to cooperate with Dundun Island too. / <> / [[Mike is so surprised that he sprays the soda which he's drinking from his can.]] http://crfh.net/d/20091002.html

[[Mike wipes his soda-covered face with a cloth he found.]] / Mike: What. Man, seriously, just... WHAT. / Dave: [[looking up]] Isn't it just what you wanted? Here I am, I surrender, you WIN. / Mike: Are you bipolar or something? Why the sudden change of heart? / Dave: Remember when I got my lasers? I didn't want them, at first. I just wanted to be a normal guy. / Dave: But I HAVE to believe things happen for a reason. Because if there's no reason, then it's just pointless misery. / Dave: Now THAT is a real reason to be angry. Not all this stupid crap about why or how you guys voted me out. / [[Dave sips his soda as Mike continues cleaning his face with the cloth.]] / Mike: Well... if you really want to do this... I'll arrange things with Dundun Island. / Dave: Let them know that I'm not going to harm animals or persons. Other than that, I can agree to more tests, IF they give me my lasers back. / Mike: Fine. Sounds fair. I'll get you back into NOES, Dave, but NO combat duties until you're cured. Are we clear? / Dave: That's okay, I can help in other ways in the meantime. / Mike: Yeah? Like what? / Dave: Research. Knowledge is power, right? / Dave: Information can be crucial. For example, did you know you're wiping your face with one of my dirty socks? / Mike: [[making a face]] BLECH! Just great, now I'll have to peel off my face with a cheese grater to get rid of the stench! / Dave: [[smiling]] Are you kidding? On you, it's an IMPROVEMENT. http://crfh.net/d/20091005.html

[[Mike returns from having dropped Dave off, as Marsha brings him a cup of coffee.]] / Marsha: So you're back. Everything okay? I hope Blue won't yell his head off. / Mike: I'm expecting there will be some yelling, but she's not that good at staying mad at Dave. / Marsha: Nice. Have some coffee, unless you want to sleep some more. / Mike: Thanks! Hey, what did you tell the guy? How did you convince him? / Marsha: I just told him the truth. You should try that, sometime. / Mike: Me? NAAAAAH. / [[Mike and Marsha sit on the couch, with Mike holding his coffee and curling his tentacle around Marsha.]] / Marsha: So tell me, Mike, what was it? Did you want Dave out to keep Blue out of NOES? Or were you just pretending, knowing that Dave always stubbornly opposes to everything you say and do? / Mike: No one shall ever, EVER know. http://crfh.net/d/20091007.html

But I'm hungry, so... please? / [[Dave grasps Blue's hand.]] / Blue: I dunno, maybe you want to go pick it up YOURSELF. / Dave: C'mon. I know it was dumb, and I apologized. Why are you still mad? / [[Blue angrily yanks her hand out of Dave's grasp.]] / Blue: You know why I'm mad, Dave! I'm mad because you got back into stupid NOES! / Blue: And you did it because you're still in love with STUPID MARGARET! http://crfh.net/d/20091009.html
http://crfh.net/d/20091012.html
[[Blue is on the couch crying. Dave is trying to explain things to her.]] / Dave: Don't cry. That's just not true and you know it! / Blue: Then whyyyyyy? / Dave: Because I care. I have to. That's what good guys do, right? I thought you liked that about me! / Blue: Not if it gets you killed, you dumbass! / Dave: Look, next time I lose my memory, it's going to drive me crazy again! / Blue: Why couldn't you just LISTEN to me? I TOLD you, it's not your fight! / Dave: Yes it is! Blue, long before I knew about Margaret's connection with Satan, he came out of a goddamn fridge and ripped out my SOUL. / Blue: That's because he knew you'd get in the way and STUFF! / Dave: Baby, do you think Mike is in NOES because he's in love with Margaret? Seriously? What about Roger? / Blue: Oh, don't even get me started on THAT! / Dave: BLUE!!! / Dave: Come here. I love YOU. C'mon. / [[Dave hugs Blue.]] / Blue: Okay *sniff* whatever. If you think it's better for you, and you think it needs to be done, I'm right behind you. / Blue: But I'm warning you, if the meetings are too boring I'm bringing a book, OK? / Dave: [[surprised]] ...

[[Dave is taping a video of himself.]] / Dave: So... yeah. Future self. / Dave: I'm assuming you're watching this because you lost your memories again. I told Blue to keep the video, but Marsha has another, just in case. / Dave: And before you start flappin' around like a headless chicken, here's what you should do. / Dave: First, ask NO questions. / Dave: I mean it. Try to talk as little as possible. Also, lock yourself in the bedroom, close the blinds, and stay all day in bed watching TV. Order food or whatever, but DON'T go out. / Dave: Also, this video is not doctored, I'm not an evil clone, and I'm not under hypnosis or on drugs. Trust me, this is for your own good. / Dave: Whatever you do, don't try to "fix" anything you might think is... wwwwrong. / [[Dave begins to get nervous.]] / Dave: Be-be-believe me, it's going to suck if you... if, if... / Dave: ARRGH! OhmiGOD, stop STARING at ME!!! / [[Dave covers his face, succumbing to his fear of public speaking.]] http://crfh.net/d/20091015.html

Oh. Well, that's good. No, wait. That's BAD. / Margaret: Yeah, well, Mike can't kill Dave, but if he makes Dave uses his lasers, that's bad too. / Roger: Boy, is the party still going on? It isn't, right? / Margaret: I have no idea. And I don't want to ask Blue or Marsha. Do you? / Roger: Hells no. / Margaret: Look, I'll keep an eye on Mike and you keep an eye on Dave.

I will have anything I want in the world, you can be sure of that. / Vernon: Yes, but *I* resurrected you. / Mike: That's what I'm saying! I mean, we're going to be a big family now, right? So I've got MY organization, and you've got yours, why are we fighting? Let's cooperate!

Damascus convinced her, too. / Dave: So we just threw ourselves upon the mercy of Dundun??? That's depressing. / Blue: Not exactly, Dave.

I didn't mean to get angry, it's just that I'm confused, and... / Blue: Second, I'm going to the grocery store.

So how could I ever agree to it? / Blue: Because you need to eat well to recover, and I totally intimidated you into accepting! / Dave: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this. I'm practically living off you. / Blue: Geez. It's for my own good too! I would hate having to label everything, and besides I cook for two! Just chill! / Dave: What about the rent? I'm not going to let you pay my rent. / Blue: We don't pay rent. I bought the apartment! Believe me, you're okay with this! You'll remember! / Dave: Are you sure?

[[Blue and Hazel are having a discussion at the Green mansion.]] / Blue: [[arms crossed, looking away]] Ma, I'm trying to think about Mike. She was his friend. He wouldn't want her dead. / Hazel: [[winding up a ball of yarn]] Like I care, Blue. Mike might have forgiven her, but not me. / Blue: It was an ACCIDENT. / Hazel: SHMACCIDENT. I know what she was up to. Besides, even if it was, no one is allowed to be clumsy around my kids. / Hazel: It's not like I get any thanks for it, right? But still. / Blue: Could you at least... finish her quickly? For me? / Hazel: Naw. The winged girl, tho, your friend? Her intentions were noble, so yeah. / Blue: [[surprised]] What, you have MARSHA???!!! *obscured* April, let Marsha go! / Hazel: LANGUAGE, Blue Violet Green. / Blue: You HAVE to let her go, Ma! It was ME who manipulated her into killing April for me! / Hazel: Well, Vernon is studying her wings mutation. When he's done I'll think about it. / Blue: You don't get it! She's mentally unstable, this could push her over the edge, and... and Mike was in LOVE with her! / Hazel: Oh, I know that, dear. / Hazel: But no one is allowed to be CRAZY around my kids, either. / [[Hazel exits the room.]] http://crfh.net/d/20080611.html

[[Blue in front of Mike's grave]] / I will try to convince the Dragon to let Marsha go, and I'll try to speak to Vernon. But I'm afraid there's not a lot I can do. / I was trying to make you feel proud of me. (Instead of making you turn in your grave fast enough for a black hole to appear.) / Please don't hate me. / [[Blue crying holding Mike's gravestone]] / This is one of those sitchs where you would have found a way.

Hey you, stop sitting on that rock and help me reach that gate! / Mystery Guy: The gate is closed. / Mike: But I can SEE you on the other side! C'mon! / Mystery Guy: I can't let you in. You have a horde of demons behind you. / Mike: But I have a horde of demons behind me! I gotta get out of here! / Mystery Guy: Do you know where is "here"? / Mike: There are demons, therefore it's HELL! / [[Mystery Guy, behind the pearly gates is facing away from the desperately running Mike.]] / Mystery Guy: You have been in Hell.

[[Mike is fleeing a horde of demons, he is just outside the gate]] / Mike: UGH, I know I'm not worth it! But if you let me in, I'll get rid of them as soon as I reach the other side. / Mystery Guy: If you can't get rid of them here, how could you do it there? / Mike: Well, I have no weapons here! I don't even have my tentacle! Besides I have this friend and she's got PLASTICS! / Mystery Guy: The demons would be unbound and way more powerful than here. This is, after all, not Hell. / Mike: You insist??? Look I made a deal with the Devil! That lands you in Hell, right? / Mystery Guy: Not necessarily. If the deal's off... / Mike: HUH?

Get dressed ASAP, the abomination list is long and the night won't last forever. / Roger: Oooooh-kaaay. Look, there are easier ways to get brains and stuff for your unholy experiments... / Margaret: NononoNO! I had this awesome dream, see?

I was dreaming about cannibal octopi, but that doesn't mean I'm going to put a cake on your head and... / Margaret: Roger, just shut up and play along! What's to loose?

[[Margaret and Roger are in Mike's graveyard ... somewhere.]] / Roger: Look, Margaret. He's gonna stink even more than when he was alive, which was a LOT.

Listen, do you see his tombstone? It says RIP, not AFK, BRB! / Margaret: My God, could you get more NERDY? / Roger: So you can say things like ASAP, but I can not? Boooo. / Margaret: Don't say "Boo!" in a graveyard! And you believe in lots of stupid thing, so why not this? / Roger: Because, Margaret, he's been dead for weeks now. No one is that badass, not even Mike, unless he is a zombie or a Warner Bros character! / Margaret: Mmh. Someone brought him flowers. Do you think it was Marsha?

This is gonna be fun! / Roger: NGGH! Margaret, I know you don't take these two seriously, but you DIDN'T see them throwing electrical orbs at people!

And it's just an incantation! / Steve: Look, maybe we can try that later. For now, check we have everything before we start. / Waldo: Aw, alright you big baby. Let's see... Dirt... Chicken... Hubcap / Steve: Check, check and check! / Waldo: Virgin's blood / Steve: That was an easy one... / Waldo: HAHA. Chew toy... Look, we already went through this list... / Steve: Check.

Okay, let's become a source of discomfort. / [[Roger and Margaret confront Steve and Waldo]] / Roger: Hey you dorks, what's up? I hope you're not attempting to dig and sex up our deceased friend and tormentor? / Steve: Why, if it's the man and the woman. A blonde woman even. / Margaret: Steve, you have a label on your ass, It says "Embed Pickaxe Here". / Steve: Oh, that's funny. We are going to dig him up, if you let up borrow your pickaxe and shovel. / Roger: Well, errrrr... whatever. You're uncool and we got here first.

I had this dream about Mike slaying some poor innocent demons... / Roger: Why can't you guys dream about mustard-wearing girls like the rest of us normal people? / Margaret: HAH! I knew that was real! So Satan sent you to resurrect Mike, but what for??? Like he has to gain something from it! / Steve: He didn't say! But apparently, if we resurrect Mike ourselves, we can bind him to our will or something! / Roger: Huh. Well, you better, you know. Not do it? / [[There is a noise behind Roger and Margaret who both look shocked. Waldo finishes casting his spell.]] / Steve: Aaaah well, it's too late for THAT.

Just direct me to their throats... / Roger: Apparently, their ritual failed. They left. / Margaret: ARGH... All this for nothing... But, but I really DID believe... / Roger: Don't make me say "I told you so", Margaret. / Margaret: Death is so final. Almost always. I was getting accostumed to hope. / Roger: Mike's dead, but WE are alive. Start trying to move, we have to get out of here. / Margaret: How long is the paralysis supposed to last? / Roger: I dunno.

Shoot me in the kneecaps? / Kitten: Fu? / Margaret (off panel): With a katana? / Joe: What? No gun? I'm so unproud. / [[Roger and Margaret crouch in the foreground and Dave stands behind Margaret.

I want to be able to look in your eyes while we talk. / Joe (off panel): I can't turn BACK to HUMAN, Margaret. / Margaret: But you were human when we... / Joe (off panel): Also, my eyes tell me nothing. I can't see. I'm blind. Dave did this to me. / Dave: BULLS**T! http://crfh.net/d/20070802.html

Dave: I did NOT blind you, Joe. And you KNOW it! / Joe: [[in werecoyote form and holding Spooky]] You deny it? It's not the first time you have done this sort of thing. I have been asking questions to the right people. / Dave: ...Wwell, I didn't say I wouldn't have, but I was blindfolded. And handcuffed. THAT you did. Remember? / Joe: Lies. I didn't blindfold you. Obviously, that was THE mistake. / Dave: You LIE like a rug, and you SMELL like one, too! / Joe: Oh, that one NEVER gets old. / Roger: [[in werecoyote form]] He's not lying. He doesn't remember. / Margaret: Joe... you don't know, do you? / Joe: Know what, sweetheart? / Margaret: That... you were possessed by the Devil.

Margaret: Are you SURE you want to drive Joe home? I can do it. We can go with you, too. / Roger: Nah, it's okay. I want to have a word or two with him, and it's kind of personal. / Margaret: Okay. But be alert. I don't think you'll run into any problem, but he MIGHT be possessed at any time, you know. / Roger: Well, so could I, right? I'm not worried. Meeting tonight? / Dave: [[thinking]] Now is the time to simply tiptoe away, light as a feather, subtle as a ninja-like thing. / Margaret: Maybe tomorrow. I want to think about all this stuff first. / Dave: [[thinking as he edges away]] Then find Osama. We can be cavemates, and... / Margaret: Dave? / Dave: Mmmmmhhhh? / Margaret: Can I *TALK* to you for a minute? / Dave: [[thinking]] Sweet. Unmerciful. CRAP. http://crfh.net/d/20070806.html

As long as it's not Dover porn... / Dave: Jesus God! What the HELL??? Is that...? / Margaret: Yes, it's blood. / Dave: EW! Why did you give me that? Are you INSANE? / Margaret: Well, it should be important, since Mike spent his last minutes alive writing it. / Dave: What? For serious? What does it say? I'm not touching that thing again. / Margaret: It says "No deals with Satan." / Dave: Uh... / Margaret: And you are going to tell me why. http://crfh.net/d/20070808.html

Dave: I wanted to tell you, Margaret, but you knew Mike ... I told him it was a huge mistake to keep it secret, but ... / Margaret: Yeah, I know. Stupid Mike. Anyway, are you SURE he didn't give Satan his 10 minutes? / Dave: Not that I know of. But you know, he could have been possessed and never know it. Just like Joe. / Margaret: Hum. Yeah, you're right. / Margaret: Anyway, see you. I'm going home. / Dave: Aren't you going to say something? / Margaret: About what? / Dave: Oh, c'mon! Stop torturing me like this! Just say it already! / Margaret: Say what? That you royally screwed up? / Dave: YES! / Margaret: What for? You know what you did... Why would I want to? / Dave: So... that's it? You're just gonna let it go? / Margaret: Ugh. You're not going to be able to sleep now, right? *SIGH* / [[Dave holds his upper right arm]] / Margaret: You're welcome. / Dave: OOW!

NOT! / Roger: Soooo... you're a werehuman, now, am I right? You can't turn back to human, because your default state is coyote-flavored. / Joe: Irredeemable dumb terminology aside, yeah. Essentially. / Roger: How much time do you have left? Do you know? / Joe: Way TOO much, probably. / Roger: Why, because it's never too soon to become a blood-thirsty killing machine? / Joe: I really pity you, if that's how you see it. / Roger: Don't you?

I'm not even closer to getting back with Blue. In fact, she probably hates me a lot more, which I didn't even think was POSSIBLE. / Dave: Even worse, I'm actually starting to miss Mike. If he was here, he'd be so annoyed at me he'd come up with some crazy and painful plan that somehow would work out in the end. / Dave: Do you think if I send her my ear over the mail, she'd forgive me? Or would she think I'm calling her a whore? / Dave: Man, I'm really BAD at this. And there's no one crazy enough to help me. / [[Roger enters the room]] / Roger: Dude!

Do I look like someone who's got his ass kicked? / Dave: Huh. Well, no? / Roger: Well, that's because Joe taught me to heal myself! / Dave: Hhhheal... / Roger: He knows LOTS of things. And he's gonna teach me! / [[Britanny jumps from Dave's stomach onto Roger's shoulder]] / Dave: He's going to WHAT??? / Roger: He's going to teach me, and he knows other werecoyotes, and he's going to take me to the parties, and stuff! / Dave: Roger, he's EVIL! / Roger: Pah.

What's that got to do with anything? / Roger: That "BLINDED by GOD" is a bit implausible? Plus, no witnesses... / Dave: Oh, yeah? Well, what about my wounds? I was healed, genius! / Roger: So you say. Who's to say you actually did get shot? / Dave: Are you GUANO INSANE? You packed my wounds YOURSELF! / Roger: Ummmm. Well, you got lasers. And lasers can like, heal... / Dave: Not THAT kind of wounds! Besides, what about the EAR wound, huh? / Roger: Maybe with a mirror... / Dave: ROGER!!! / Roger: Uh... / Roger: Wait a minute.... hum. I guess you're right. Bah. / Dave: [[rolling eyes]] Finally!

Dave: Listen, dude, could you give it a rest? Can't you just let me suffer in peace? / Roger: I won't give it a rest, because it's a fish that needs POKING! Are you gonna vacuum, or NOT??? / Dave: Sheesh, man! What are you, a 50's HOUSEWIFE? / Roger: ARGH! Dave, we've discussed this! If we're going to get a new roommate to split the rent with, we need to clean up this joint! / Dave: Huh??? / [[Flashback - Dave and Roger are in the living room]] / Roger: And since I have the space suit, I guess I get the kitchen? And the bathroom. But since those are the hardest parts, you get everything else. / Roger: That means you gotta vacuum and possibly clean anything gross on the floor or walls. We have lots of industrial strength cleaner Mike bought by the bulk. / Roger: It gives you cancer! / Roger: Which reminds me, one of your jobs will be packing Mike's crap. We need the space and it's probably not right that we keep the stuff, even if the Dragon's moolah has its own zip code. / [[Dave is staring at the blue frosting on his doughnut.]] / [[Flashback - Dave and Roger are walking to class]] / Roger: ...

I *know* we need another roommate, but I just can't stop thinking about Blue. I can't help it. / Roger: Well, dude. You're not going to solve anything by sitting on your ass.

Listen, Rog, I have a question about something I found under Mike's bed. / Roger: That would be MY bed now, and you know our policies. / [[Dave is in the hallway.]] / Roger: [[off-panel]] Either it's garbage, or it's not. If it is, then you put it in a black garbage bag. Minus the recyclables, of course. Those go in an orange bag. / Roger: [[off-panel]] Unless you want Captain Planet to shoot our kneecaps off. That ho. / Dave: What about the organic stuff? / Roger: [[off-panel]] Sheesh, are you a n00b or what? You have to put it in a different bag.

With a human liver. / Dave: Well, I'm no biologist, so it could be any other organ? / Dave: Also, maybe it's not human, and I'm not sure if that can be classified as a jar, since it's... / Roger: UGH. Shut your pie trap for a sec. Thinking. / Dave: Yeah? Do you know what we should do? / Roger: Yeah. Let's give THIS bed to the new guy, and I'll take the futon, or... / Dave: I mean BESIDES that. / Roger: You're crazy if you think I'm gonna "recycle" that liver. / Dave: I didn't mean that... but thank God. / Roger: Because man, I HATE liver.

What ELSE can we do? / Roger: We're gonna get rid of it ourselves, of course! / Dave: Are you CRAZY??? We can't do that! / Roger: Hell yes we CAN. Do you want to attract the Waldo and Steve type? / Dave: Roger, we CAN'T become accessories to murder just because of the new roomie! / Roger: Not JUST because! Think about Mike's family! / Roger: They're going to be mightily pissed if they know we tattled to the pigs! / Dave: Goddammit. / Roger: That's right!

Well, since you're here with your stink beasts, I suppose you finished cleaning? / Roger, it's midnight and I'm exhausted.

[[Dave is lying on the couch clutching his sore head, while Margaret is still looking at papers in her hand.]] / Dave: Uh huh... look, whatever TWISTED, ABNORMAL reason Roger made those drawings... most are of Blue. And none of Marsha. So they're not Mike's. THERE. / Margaret: I dunno... who says she's not keeping them? I mean, we all knew Mike was a sentimental weirdo. I'm sure he wouldn't hide his drawings from her. / Dave: Now you're just speculating. And when you speculate, you make a spec of... you... and... late. Unm. OWW. / Margaret: And how do you know the letters were for Roger? / Dave: AGAIN! They can't be for Mike, because that would be CREEPY! / Margaret: Well... I'm looking, but Roger is never mentioned anywhere. / Dave: AHAHA! More evidence! Who ever mentions the name of the letter recipient? NO ONE! That's WHO! / Margaret: Dave? These letters are from five years ago. / Dave: Well, he COULD be a time traveler, OKAY???? http://crfh.net/d/20071011.html

Dave: Okay, so I screwed up. Why do I need to apologize? I punched him without any reason, and he almost got me killed. We're sort of even, right? / Margaret: Because if he moves out, there's no NOES anymore? / Dave: But why don't we just let it sit for a day or two? Then, when he's a little less pissed, we can have a meeting... / Margaret: Here's a tip, Dave: time only makes things worse. When you need to apologize, you do it right away. / Dave: Are you trying to tell me something? / Margaret: I'm just trying to tell you that your really cute butt is the only thing standing between us and the Apocalypse. That's all. / Dave: No pressure there, huh? Well, thank you. / Margaret: Really Dave, you only need to do some squats to keep it fit. http://crfh.net/d/20071012.html

You should know I profess absolute loyalty to the French cubism. / Dave: And chibi? / Roger: And chibi. Now go away, I still have a lot to pack. / Dave: But... you don't have to go away. I said I'm sorry. / Roger: I'm sorry too, I really flew off the handle there. I guess we've all been on edge since Mike died. Here, have some peace second-hand licorice whip. / [[Roger offers the licorice whip to Dave. We see that he is wearing a shirt which says "Hot Dog".]] / Dave: Uh... that isn't the licorice whip you were hitting that bald guy with, is it? / Roger: Yes it is.

But hey, I'll attend NOES meetings. / Dave: Loser ditcher excuser. No less, no more. / Roger: I'll leave you a list of candidates, and... oh. I almost forgot. / [[Roger tosses Dave the keys to Mike's convertible.]] / Dave: Uh? Wait, the keys to the convertible? What for? / Roger: I'll deprive myself of Madame's pleasant company, just so YOU can return Mike's things. / Dave: What? / Roger: C'mon, did you really think I was doing it for the new roommate? I was hoping you'd put two and two together. / Dave: Right. RIGHT, I could do that. I could definitely do that. Mmmh, but... / [[Marsha, still grim and silent, is in the bedroom closet, eavesdropping on Dave and Roger.]] / Roger: [[off-panel]] But nothing.

The way you treat me, you'd think I was a troll or something. / Blue: Humm. / Jay: I'm joking, Blue. I will be going on my way.

Well, what makes you think I don't already HAVE what you're offering? / Jay: I know you hired some P.I.s to find Blondie, but if you found her, you wouldn't be in a funk, would you? But there's no need for that. Mom bugged her that time she went to visit Mike. / Blue: THAT is your information? I already know that!

I would just REALLY like to know what you were doing while Mike was bleeding to death. / Blue: You were supposed to be looking for him to tell him about Dad. Where WERE you? / [[Flashback: Dave, having been ejected from the chopper, returns to his room, fuming]] / [[Dave starts to have a bath, still fuming]] / [[Dave drops off]] / Dave: <> http://crfh.net/d/20070511.html

[[Roger is sitting on the couch, playing with the remote control. Dave stands behind the couch, his face buried in the top cushion]] / Roger: Cheer up, Dave. Mike's not really dead. / Dave: *groan* / Roger: After all, he'll live forever in our hearts. And in our... nightmares, no doubt. / Dave: Roger, Blue hates me. I don't CARE about Mike. / Roger: Oh, that's what you say. / Dave: No, she REALLY hates me. And I can't blame her. / Roger: I mean about Mike. Sure you care about Mike. He was your friend, so it's only natural you... / Dave: Mike? My friend? That's a laugh. With friends like that, who needs a dent in the middle of the skull? / Roger: That's a very unheathy attitude, Dave. You should face your grief, instead of pretending you don't miss Mike. / Dave: You know, you're right. I really wish Mike was alive. So I could kill him again for managing to RUIN my life even when he's dead. / Roger: That's the spirit! Twenty points for paradox. Also, if you *really* miss him, I can give you Paul's phone number. / Dave: You, on the other hand, are like a dent in the middle of the ass. http://crfh.net/d/20070516.html
http://crfh.net/d/20070518.html
Roger: Well, if you're really glad Mike's dead, I'm not surprised Blue is pissed at you. / Dave: Are you nuts? Do you really think I'd tell her something like this? She hates me for entirely different reasons. / Roger: Like what, being a huge hypocrite? Besides, I wouldn't bad-mouth the dead if I were you. They tend to come back as ghosts and haunt your underwear. / Dave: Your brain is made of styrofoam and non-sequiturs. I'm going to bed. / [[Dave, in his room, rummages through his sock drawer]] / Dave: [[thinking]] Stupid Roger... what does he care? / Dave: [[thinking]] But what if he's right? What if Blue thinks I hated Mike? What if she thinks I had actually something to do with his... / [[In the loungeroom, Roger is startled by...]] / Dave: [[off-panel]] <> http://crfh.net/d/20070518.html

You really should wash your undies if you're spontaneously generating stuff now. / Dave: They didn't spawn, dork, they're Chester's! Bad cat! Bad cat! HORNY cat! / [[Chester leers shamelessly at Dave]] / Roger: Well, it's your fault for not buying him a chastity belt. / Dave: Man, what am I gonna DO with these kittens? I can barely afford food for MYSELF! / Roger: Table scraps? / Dave: Uh... Roger, *I* eat table scraps. / Roger: Point! But I think they still don't eat. Isn't the mom supposed to feed them milk? / Dave: Maybe? God, I really don't know anything about kittens. / Roger: Luckily for you, I am a vast source of random knowledge. / Dave: So, when are they supposed to eat? / Roger: I suppose their larval stage ends when their tails fall off. http://crfh.net/d/20070521.html

Margaret: Uh...Marsha? I know you probably don't feel like it, but we're having a NOES meeting at the guys'. In case you want to join us. Or something? I think you should. It would be good for everybody. / Margaret:I mean...I think Mike probably wouldn't have liked it if you just gave up on everything. Especially something he worked so hard for. And...I dunno...uh... / Margaret: Listen, would it absolutely kill you to at least acknowledge I'm talking to you? / [[Marsha sits, head down, like she has the past three panels.

Margaret: Gentlemen, move your butts, we're having a NOES meeting! / Dave: WHAT, right NOW??? / Margaret: Yeah, why not? It's Saturday night, don't tell me you have plans that are not nerdy! / Roger: Excuse me, but this meeting was not scheduled, and I have a girlfriend, and I COULD have plans... / Margaret: Schedules are for bureaucrats, now move it! / Dave: Margaret, I don't think we're ready to - / Margaret: Do I need to drag you by your nostrils, or WHAT? / Dave: oooKAAAY, someone had boss for lunch... / Roger: Yeah, who died and made you the leader, anyway? / [[Dave and Margaret look disapproving at Roger.]] / Roger: What? http://crfh.net/d/20070528.html
http://crfh.net/d/20070530.html
Margaret: So yeah, to sum it up...our numbers have been reduced. We also need a new leader for the group. I can take over, but of course, if anyone opposes, I can remind you that our former leader is now as dead as a...really dead person. Any contestants? / Dave or Roger (off-screen): Pass. / Dave or Roger (off-screen): Pass them. / Margaret: Innuendo aside, here's my first idea: let all the meetings be at my place. Cuz you know, yours stinks like a dinosaur's corpse. / Dave or Roger (off-screen): Sure, why not? / Dave or Roger (off-screen): As long as you bring lollies. / Margaret: Excellent. Now, you'll probably find my approach a bit aggresive. This is normal and soon you'll be the kicking-ass machines I intend you to become, instead of the wet-noodle planaria normal you. / Roger: Can we make like a planaria and SPLIT? / Margaret: Nonsense. So, I'm going to need some data from you guys, like pain treshold, and stuff. / Dave: I think I'll just quit NOES and go for a less dangerous hobby, like 18-wheeler surfing. http://crfh.net/d/20070530.html

Dave: What, we're going to Joe's house, for serious? Why? / Roger: Wait, isn't Joe the guy with like a zillion guns and a tendency for possession? / Margaret: Yep, he's the one. And we're going to ask him a few questions about it. / Dave: That's INSANE! The guy's a PSYCHO! / Margaret: He's not. Or at lesat not all of the time. But anyway, you shouldn't worry, because you're not going. Just Roger and I. / Dave: Uh? Not that I really wanted to, but why not? / Margaret: You have a history with the guy, Dave. You'll be the backup. We'll call you if we run into trouble, okay? / Dave: You're not protecting me again, are you? I'm perfectly capable of defending myself... / Roger: Truth is, Dave, she's just saving you for the most dangerous jobs. Like washing your hands with PRISSY soap, and stuff. / Dave: Roger, we now live in the same bedroom. So don't get me started. / Roger: Hey, I'm a manly man, and I will indulge in wearing footy pajamas if I want to! / Margaret: Yeah...speaking of prissy pajamas...Let's start talking about your PHYSICAL training schedule. http://crfh.net/d/20070601.html

Marsha, don't scare me like that! Why didn't you join us, instead of appearing just right now? / FLASHBACK: / Marsha: Mike! Mike, baby, help is on the way, just just st-tand still, okay? / Mike: Kay.

Yeah right. / Jay: I'm serious. Do you want the pictures? I have pictures. / Blue: Oooookayyyyyy. Nunnery, huh? So, what? / Jay (off-panel): I'm only saying, Blue. He hides lots of things.

http://crfh.net/d/20070615.html
Blue: Ooh my God. Do I look that dumb? Seriously. Do I have a DUMB face? / Jay: What? Why? / Blue:I don't know, maybe because the same weekend you went blind, he appeared with TWO bullet wounds. And I learned to put two and two together in GRADE school. / Jay: But you weren't there, were you? And did he tell you about it, or not? / Blue:No, he didn't. Still, stop trying to imply he's up to no good. / Jay: I'm not implying. I'm WONDERING. Doesn't it worry you? / Blue:Worried? Pfft. / Blue:I'm not afraid of Dave. / Blue:But Dave is afraid of me. / Blue:And maybe he SHOULD. / Blue:After all, who am I?

But Roger, last time we had a conversation like this one, we ended up shanghaied because YOU couldn't keep your part of the deal. / Roger: I can't do that this time! If we go alone against her, she's going to overkill us and feed us to the HYENAS! / Margaret: Hey Roger, remember I'm going to your place tonight to sort out the details of the Joe thing... / [[Roger salutes]] / Roger: Sir! Yes, sir! / Margaret: Hahah! See ya! / Roger: Did... you hear the one about the space monkey, the stoned nurse, and the slippery zucchini? Heh!

Mike managed to get in there too, but, alas... / Dave: There's a dog in the back yard. Keep THAT in mind. / Margaret: Well, we're going through the front door. Roger, if you see my signal and there's a chance, you do some snooping of your own. / Dave: I still don't see why I can't go with you guys. / Margaret: I told you, you're the backup. Also, we can't bring weapons. Unconcealed ones, at least. / Roger: That's a bit... too suicidal for my tastes. / Margaret: Like I said before, this guy has more guns than me. We'll have to be diplomatic. Uhhhh... yeah, you're right, it DOES sound suicidal... / Roger: Mmmh. / Dave: Look, guys. Do you want information? You really don't need to go through all this trouble. / Margaret: No? Do you have a better idea? / Dave: Just get me inside and give me 10 minutes with him.

I need you to call him. And ask if you can come back for a while. / [[Flashback: June, still talking to April on the phone, is now looking somewhat annoyed.]] / June: What? Are you serious? No way. / June: Well, it's not that I'm very worried that you'd be pretending to be me, but I have an artist rep, April. I can't let you ruin it. / June: Fine. But if you screw up, I know nothing.

Imaginary Wiser Floating April: NO. Listen to me, April, even if it's the LAST thing you ever do. It's one thing... it's one thing to you know, sabotage Marsha because of some... twisted sense of justice, or competition, or JarJar knows WHAT. But this, this is SUICIDE! There's no way you can get away with it! What's Marsha gonna think when she sees you with that dress??? She might be stupid, but she's not THAT stupid! Now, the only way to fix this is... you know, give Marsha YOUR dress. Only then she'll believe you didn't stain her dress on purpose. Stop this. Stop it, while there's still time. I have a bad feeling about this, April. I think something HORRIBLE is gonna happen if you don't stop! / April: NO. You see... that's where you are wrong. You think I won't stop. But the truth is... I CAN'T. http://crfh.net/d/20061027.html

No, it doesn't go EXACTLY like that. / Mike: But in spirit... / Dave: Yeah. Pretty much. Hum! Why did YOU get a haircut? / Mike: Why not? You're the only one assuming it's a bad thing, or that I'm picking on you, or something. / Dave: I thought it was because you're seriously whipped, and Marsha "suggested" you do it. / Mike: Don't say "whipped" and Marsha in the same sentence. EVER. / Dave: Oh? Now the truth is taboo? / Mike: No, but you're making me horny, and she won't be here until she's all dolled up, and that'll be in like seven million years. / Dave: How much does your Mom charge for memory erasing, and does she take Nookiecard? http://crfh.net/d/20061030.html

I have given worse wedgies than that to people with stupid bumper stickers. Get a grip or something. You deserved it. / Dave: I was just joking. You know, it was obvious. / Margaret: No it wasn't! You know I'm all paranoid about the people I love and stuff, and you just... / Blue: Okay, I'm totally lost. Wedgie? Love? WHA? / Dave: It doesn't really matter. Let's just go. / Margaret: What I said. Whatever. / Blue: Waaaaaait a minute. I think I know what's going on here. / Margaret: Really. Wow. You must be brilliant, because I really have no idea myself. / Blue: Well. Any idiot can see it! Dave loves you, but you despise and diss Dave, and as soon as we start having our own thing, SUDDENLY you start wanting him! Isn't it? / Margaret: That's not... / Blue: There's a name for that! And honey, it is NOT love. Do I need to say it? C'mon, tell me you want to hear it. / Margaret: You know, little girl. You should really BACK OFF. Before I ruin your expensive dental work. / Blue: Oh, I'm trembling! NOT! Probably because I have really good friends in really bad places... I can guarantee that for every bone you break, you'll get twice as much broken! / Margaret: Well, then maybe I should go all the way and break your SKULL. / Blue: Maybe!

You decided that all i ever do is make you suffer, and i'm not just going to play the guilt game anymore. / Dave: Margaret, i just, I... I... AAAAAAAARGHGH!!! / Dave: You know what?

Anyway, here's mine: first, no violence. / Margaret: What, not even a little bit? / Dave: No. Also, no yelling. No name-calling. No bad-mouthing Blue. / Margaret: WhatEVER! / Dave: No touching. No kissing. No hugging. No nothing. / Margaret: You have some NERVE! / Dave: Also, we either leave as friends, or as merely neighbors and members of NOES. And that's it. / Margaret: Is that so? Fine. I only have one rule. You will talk about your feelings, without expecting me to guess them, or getting angry because I don't. You will talk, even if it hurts. Especially if it hurts. Agreed? / Dave: Uh, can I change some of my rules? / Margaret: Sit. Your ass. DOWN. Dave. http://crfh.net/d/20061113.html

Just say the word, I only need to get my chainsaw gauntlet. / Blue: Not really. I think Dave just needs to be able to sort this stuff on his own, without lots of mutilation. / Mike: Blue. I'm sorry, but that's dumb. As if Dave was ever capable of sorting anything. He's just Our Lady of Perpetual Confusion. / Blue: I have to believe he can do it. If he can't...

Look, can't you just go away? Is it a lot to ask? / April: Bah, disappointing. I thought you'd enjoy playing. It seems you like mind games only if you're the one behind them. YAAWN!

Mike: Wow, is he possessed or something? / Roger: Possessed by what, the ghost of BARNEY??? / Dave: I'm not possessed, folks! Why shouldn't I be happy? The day is pretty, the birds are singing, the sun is shining! / Mike: You're happy??? Okay, now I'm freaking out. / Roger: Maybe a legion of smurf ghosts? / Dave: More importantly, my tank is full, and I'm off to the pool to watch bikinis until my eyes fall off! See you not, hopefully! / [[Dave leaves, poolward]] / Mike: This is very serious, Roger. / Roger: I know it's very serious, Mike. / Mike: We have to find out what the Hell's wrong with him. This is... this is an ABOMINATION. / Roger: I agree. I suggest we follow him and take note of all that suspicious bikini watching. / Mike: Dude, do you ever think with your *other* head? / Roger: Lemme think. Ummmm. Nope. http://crfh.net/d/20060612.html

No one EVER thinks I'm awesome. / Dave: Doesn't DIANA think you're awesome? / Roger: Diana thinks algae is awesome. / Dave: Well, maybe it's because you can't stop talking about yourself when you see others in pain? / Roger: No, I'm sure it's just jealousy over the size of my johnson. http://crfh.net/d/20060626.html

Can't we have one single hour without an incident of some kind? / Margaret: Are you aware that you're the least indicate to give this lecture? / Mike: Wha, why? I'm being nice.

My bikini doesn't fit, because I'm a frigging hippo, and so you're taking me to the hippo store to pick a new one! / Mike: But, but but! I'm so HAPPY here! I don't want to LEAVE! / Marsha: Save it, minion! Of course, it's either shopping or we can chat about the lustful looks you were giving to my slutonic roommate. / Mike: Uh I, uuuh... wait, isn't that TOM over there? / Marsha: WHERE WHO TOM WHERE???

You weren't there! / Mike: Well, I was hiding! / Dave: So was I. Now bug off! / Mike: No, I think we should stick together, as a defense strategy against evil women. / Dave: What KIND of defense strategy? / Mike: Well, you could take the bullet for me and go shopping with Marsha, and I could refrain myself from talking to Blue about you kissing Margaret! / Dave: Son of a...! Well, *I* could tell Marsha about you groping April! / Mike: It's a mexican standoff!

Mike: Oh WAIT, I've got a good one. If you don't go shopping with Marsha, I'll tell Blue about your boobie cannibalism. / Dave: I'm sure that if I explained her everything she'd forgive me. So why don't you go visit the shark petting zoo? / Mike: Well uuuh eeeh ohh I KNOW! You OWE me, because I paid Paul to stop whipping you, and you destroyed my CELL PHONE! / Dave: Man, AGAIN with your stupid cell phone??? You know I can't pay for it! You can't make me your slave forever because of it! / Mike: Why NOT? Give me a good reason! After all, you're not even my friend!

And the swimsuit IS great. / Margaret: So, what's the big deal. / Marsha: Nothing. I'm just disappointed. It took me forever to find a bikini that looked good on me and hid my wings. / Margaret: Don't be ridiculous. You can't gain three pounds from a tiny bag of airline peanuts. / [[April is sitting beside the pool, barely wearing her tiny bikini. She's surrounded by men]] / Marsha: [[off-panel]] Well, it's not only that. It's just that everything's going wrong in this trip for me. Do you believe in karma? / Margaret: [[off-panel]] Sort of. Probably. Why? / Marsha: [[off-panel]] I guess you can say I'm feeling a little guilty. / Margaret: [[off-panel]] Guilty over what, April? / Marsha: [[off-panel]] Yeah, her. I mean, doesn't she look so pathetically desperate for attention? / Margaret: [[off-panel]] I dunno, I think she's actually having a good time. / Marsha: [[off-panel]] I sincerely hope so, because I feel like I haven't done a lot to help her.

At least for a while. I wonder how that nun got that giant metal ruler past security? / Mr. Hand: *sob* / Diana: I don't know! But giving that kind of service for free is unfair competition! / Paul: Don't mind me and keep on walking! I just want to check... uh, I want to make sure there are no terrorist mice following us! / Dave: Yeah, you check that! And check it good, because if I catch you staring at my butt, you get a free sex-change surgery! / Paul: Well, that might not be so bad! It all depends on the instruments and methods! http://crfh.net/d/20060222.html

[[In the airport]] / Mike: What? Man, this is getting ridiculous... How was I supposed to know the mice thing would happen? And why is it my fault that YOU were stupid enough to laser your pants into lingerie? / Dave: It's your fault, because nothing like this would have happened to me if I was home like I wanted to! / Mike: Ok, Dave. You know what? You are RIGHT. It's all my fault. But can you please not mention it again? For the duration of the trip? / Dave: Or else what? / Mike: Or I'll f[[obscured]] you so HARD they're gonna have to replace your colon with PVC pipes. / Dave: Oh YEAH???

In fact, I'm not even his friend, and furthermore, I'm straight as an ARROW. / Mike: Uh, straight as a CROOKED arrow. / Dave: Straight as a straight arrow, and I don't know why Mike wants to think he's gay, and I don't care. Just count me out of your little ego quarrel. / Dad: Whatever rocks your yacht, Pantless Boy. I have to say, Mike, at least he sort of looks like a girl. There might be hope for you yet. / Mike: If Hope's a chick, I'm not into them. / Dave: [[with a laser-like glint in his eye]] I know a girl named Pain.

But ANYWAY, you lasered my face the other day for no reason at all. Consider that an advance. / Dave: Dammit. Good luck, then.

I LOVE this thing! No one is taking it away from me! NO ONE! / Thadeus: I'm sorry, sir, but I'll have to inform her. She has hidden microphones in random places, and I can't take that chance. / Mike: Ooooh, all right. Go tell her. I'm gonna tell her some things myself, as well. / Thadeus: I have nothing to hide, sir. / Mike: Yeah, it's time she knows that you've been in love with her all these years! / Thadeus: I am not, sir. / Mike: Aaw. Poor Thadeus...you think you can hide it from everybody. You think no one has noticed you, following her around the halls, and sighing, and smiling...by golly, YOU, smiling! That's almost FRIGHTENING! / Thadeus: That...that is not true... / Mike: Sure, you can lie to me, man. But when my mother looks at you with those big blue eyes, and asks you..."Is it true, Thadeus? Do you really love me?"...Do you think you're gonna be able to LIE? Pfeh! It's over! / Thadeus: MMGGHHN... / Thadeus: *Sniff!* I thought...I thought she had a thing for bald men...*sniff* / Mike: There, there.

Is that it? / Blue: Exactly WHY are you mad now? Is it because I'm being nice? Fine, I won't! And since you have not been nice to me either, I guess that means the deal is OFF!

But my father didn't like him at all. So what he did was hire a squad of football players to beat him up. / Mike's mom: After he got out of the body cast, I ran away with him. / Thadeus: So if you punish him, Miss Blue would take his side. / Mike's mom: And probably do something foolish.

"Return of the Zombies, XII", or "Steel Magnolias?" / Marsha: Meeeh. / Mike: What's the matter? / Marsha: Aw. The girls have been sharing secrets while I was home. I feel so left out. / Marsha: And now they're all hushy and whispery around me. They have been speaking in code since I came back. Apparently it's something big, but I can't tell what. / Mike: REALLY. / Marsha: Yeah... what? Do you know anything about it? / Mike: No, no... I just get the same vibe. / Marsha: Are we gonna do something about it? / Mike: Last time it blew up right in our faces, didn't it. / Mike: It's none of our business. And when something is none of your business and you don't care, people tend to talk without even noticing that you're there. Do you follow me? / Marsha: Like a little rubber duckie with its rubber mother. http://crfh.net/d/20020606.html

You have done nothing since he zapped you. / Blue: And yet he tried to jump out of the window yesterday! Don't you see the BEAUTY of it? / Hazel: OH! Well... that IS true... / Hazel: Very well, then.

Even if it kills me to admit it. / Blue: [[turning the restraining hold into a hug]] You really suck at being evil. Did you know that, Dave? / Dave: I guess. Hey, are they gone?

Why are you so mad at me? Do you still believe I told Mike to pummel you because you rejected me? Is that it? / Dave: No, that's not it. You don't want to know. And besides, it's all my fault. It has nothing to do with you. / Blue: Screw you. I don't care. I DESERVE to know. / Dave: But it doesn't make any sense. / Blue: Do you EVER make any sense? Start spilling it. / Dave: All right. But don't say I didn't warn you. I was angry at you, because... because it was not supposed to be you. / Blue: Uh??? / Blue: My mom wasn't supposed to tease me with you.

Gods, it was unbearable. / Blue: So all this time you've been angry at Margaret. And you just took it out on me. / Dave: I'm not angry at her. I CAN'T. She owes me nothing. She promised me nothing. / Blue: So why are you telling ME this? Why don't you tell HER? / Dave: What for? She would tell me to lighten up. She just doesn't understand. Nobody understands... / Blue: Understand WHAT? / Dave: Nobody understands why it's such a big deal for me. / Blue: Is it... is it because of the way your heart flutters around in your chest every time she says your name? / Dave: Yes. / Blue: And because the first thing in the morning and the last thing before you go to bed is that desperate need to see her again? / Dave: Right. / Blue: And because you've already forgiven her for all the times she will break your heart? / Dave: Uh-huh. / [Blue's crying] / Blue: You're right, Dave. / Blue: Nobody understands. http://crfh.net/d/20020425.html

Promise me that you won't let her hurt you too much. And, and that you'll call me if you need to talk... / Dave: I promise. / Blue's Grandma: Oh good! You're already doing your work!

Five points LESS! / Roger: I was not pointing your failure points. It was a nonsense comment. / Lily: Well, THAT sentence made sense. 10 points less. / Roger: So did yours. 20 points less. And where are you gonna get a chimp? / Lily: "Rent-A-Chimp". Obviously. / Roger: [[off-panel]] AAAAAARGGHH! / <> / Roger's mom: KIDS!!! / Lily: Hey Mom!

We're staying and that's IT! / Roger: You're only THREE minutes older than me, you know. / Lily: And don't forget three minutes WISER! / Roger: Pfah.

She's probably in a hyper-alert state by now. / [[April, Dave, Margaret and Roger are skulking off in various directions]] / Marsha: [[off-panel]] Hey! Hold it RIGHT there, BITCHES! http://crfh.net/d/20051206.html

Marsha: Well, where are you supposed to be going, huh? / Dave: I don't know. Into oblivion? / Roger: In a squeaky supermarket trolley. Probably while on fire. / Marsha: Look, if you weren't too busy drooling all over your miseries, you'd have noticed Mike's talking to Dover! You know, to save your prrreeeciousss little BUTTS? / Dave: Uh, yeah, so what can WE do? / Marsha: The LEAST you can do is wait for him and THANK him, maybe??? / April: Bah. Mike? He'll be fine. He always is. / Marsha: Of course he will. That's not the POINT. Because even if he wasn't, his so-called friends wouldn't be around for him. Isn't that pretty? / Margaret: She's right. Well, at least I'm staying. / Roger: So many negatives. Can't process. / Dave: You are? Why the Heck? / Margaret: Because Mike's the kind of person that would never ask for help, even if he needed it. / Dave: And YOU should know, right? / Margaret: Hey, I'm just applying my standard double-standard. / Roger: Also, we REALLY like the moon. http://crfh.net/d/20051207.html

And close the door behind you. / Mike: .... okay... / Mike: So... what is this all about? / Mr. Dover: Well, I just wanted to tell you that there's no need to keep the pretense. You know? / Mike: Uh? / Mr. Dover: I have heard... certain things. About you. / Mike: What things? / Mr. Dover: Interesting things. I have to admit, it's not easy for me either. http://crfh.net/d/20051208.html

Mr. Dover: Go on. I want to hear it. Just admit it, and we'll talk about it. / Mike: Admit what? You're starting to freak me out, sir... / Mr. Dover: You think you're the only one? C'mon. It's not going to be as bad as you think. / Mike: Look, Mr. Dover. I just don't KNOW what you're talking about. / [[Mr. Dover jumps on Mike]] / Mr. Dover: Leaving me all the initiative?

When you guys want to die, just get between these two. / April: This is perfectly useless, Marsha. Knowing Mike, he'll actually be pissed that we're here waiting for him as if he was some sort of prissy princess soft fluffy girl. / Marsha: You know, April, I have the hunch I MIGHT know Mike maybe just a LITTLE better than you, don't you think? / April: Bitch. / Marsha: *Engaged* bitch! http://crfh.net/d/20051212.html

Wow, you're truly a maelstrom of misery. / Dave: Well, if I was you, and Mike didn't love me, that would be a very good start. / April: You're not a girl. / Dave: I could be any carbon-based life form, and probably any silicon-based life form too, and it STILL would be true. / April: Well, what do you think *I* am? / Dave: A hate-based life form? / Marsha: So, I've got faith Mike will fix this thing for us. But if he doesn't, I expect you all to be supportive. AND grateful. Dig? / Margaret: I dunno. When I try to be supportive, the receiving end usually needs therapy aftwerwards. / Roger: Why should I be grateful? I'm sure he will make sure I pay dearly for this. / Marsha: Aw, it's just so he doesn't appear like the big softie he is. / [[Mike joins them]] / Mike: [[completely shell-shocked]] I think I need a hug. http://crfh.net/d/20051213.html

Ain't you giving the man his hug??? Because *I* sure as Hell AM! / Marsha: Don't worry, honey, I won't let that thing hug you. / Mike: If you KNEW what I had to do to fix the test thing, you'd give me a big birthday box with a FACEHUGGER inside. / Roger?: [[off-panel]] I'm up for macaroni. http://crfh.net/d/20051214.html

Any of our places could be bugged. Thanks April! / April: [[off-panel]] Aw, it was just a little white lie... / Dave: Whatever. Can we get to it? All this sunlight is bad for my depression. / Roger: [[off-panel]] Not to mention the ant hills. HAH! HAH! OUCH! / Marsha: All I'm saying is that if I get the dooky you won't get the nookie. / Mike: [[off-panel]] Aaaanyway. It has come to my attention that we all hate each other. Normally I wouldn't give a damn, but I'm a bit concerned this could be some sort of "Divide and Conquer" strategy... / Roger: Why would Satan need a strategy? You're all JERKS! / Margaret: Not to mention far too sensitive drama queens. / Dave: [[off-panel]] I suggest that I laser your heads off! THAT'll solve the problem! / Roger: Nah, too flashy. Let's get all in a huge orgy instead. / April: I sexcond the idea. When do we vote? http://crfh.net/d/20060109.html

Mike: [[off-panel]] No, we're not gonna have an orgy. Unless you guys are out. And April. / Roger: Aaaw... / April: Aaaaw... / Margaret: Well, I have no beefs with any of you. Roger and Dave seem to hate me, tho. / Roger: I don't hate you. But you killed my mother and sexed me up. That was bad too, for some reason... oh yeah, that Dave hates me. / Dave: [[off-panel]] I don't hate you or Margaret. Enjoy a lifetime of filthy unloyal sex and LEAVE ME ALONE. / Mike: [[off-panel]] All right, enough... SEE what I'm saying??? / Margaret: So, what's the deal? / Mike: [[off-panel]] Well, I thought maybe spending Spring Break all together could help. / Dave: [[off-panel]] Jesus Christ and Castro FORBID! / Mike: Aw, shut up. Think about it! All expenses paid, third-world country where we're not legally underage... / Marsha: Warm weather, nice sun, better beaches! / Mike: And since we're going to annoy my father, we are free to be ourselves at our WORST! / Dave: [[off-panel]] Yeah, that DOESN'T sound like a recipe for disaster... http://crfh.net/d/20060110.html

That's bad. I was gonna tell Diana and Paul to come along too. / Roger: And the catch keeps getting bigger and bigger! Now I HAVE to join in. / Margaret: If you say it's good for NOES, then I'm in too. / April: Hey, are you gonna be wearing shorts or briefs? / Mike: [[off-panel]] Shorts. / April: TINY shorts? / Mike: [[off-panel]] NO. / April: Me and my scissors are IN! / Margaret: I'm not doing it for potential weapon shopping. But if the occasion comes, why not? / Dave: Have fun, all of you. / Mike: You gotta be kidding. / Dave: I'm not. Two days on that raft with you guys were enough to immunize me against ocean jones for at least TEN years. / Mike: You know Dave, it takes a special kind of skill to take a free trip to GirlsGoneWildLand and turn it into a BAD thing. / Dave: No, it just takes a very special kind of LIFE! http://crfh.net/d/20060111.html

By the way, you look WAY too calm for someone who hasn't packed and needs to leave for the airport in an hour. / Dave: What, an hour??? Wait a minute, why do I care? I'm not going on your stupid trip! / Mike: Ba-pssch. Of course you are. / Dave: No, I'm NOT! / Mike: Start packing already. What was I looking for again? / Dave: Your brain, maybe? I SAID I'm not going! / Mike: [[poking Dave in the chest]] Look, man. You owe me BIG time. I let you use my cell phone (which you destroyed on a whim), saved your ass from Dover, saved your ass from my MOM, and I'm giving you an all-expenses paid trip to Topless Paradise. The only thing I'm asking in return is that you pretend to be my gay lover! / Dave: Well it's true that I... Uh, what? Did you just SAY what I think you said? / Mike: Yes you did!

Get used to the idea. / Roger: Aw. We could use one, you know. It doesn't have to be a really big one... / Mike: Roger, I'm trying to think here. What's your fixation with orgies lately, man? / Roger: Well, it's because of Diana. She's upset because she thinks we don't like her enough to invite her to our orgies. / Mike: But we haven't HAD any orgies!!! / Roger: Isn't that always the core of all trouble? http://crfh.net/d/20060113.html

Let me think for a moment. / April: Your wings were under your skin all this time. So there has to be SOME way for them to fit under your regular clothes. Umm-huh... / April: Yeah, hard. But really, we're girls. I mean, how do we fit in our clothes after the holidays? How do we walk around in 10-inch heels without breaking our ankles? / April: Laws of physics just don't apply to US. / April: Being a woman, Marsha, is the Art of the IMPOSSIBLE. http://crfh.net/d/20040804.html

{{Author's note: Small note about this storyline: As you probably noticed, the Dun-dun Island saga has finished. We still have to deal with the aftermath of it, but for this week, though, we're having a small intermission of events out of the normal continuity. This storyline, Elastic, is canon, but it's situated in the past, between "Holidays Too" and "It had to be You". I know a lot of you are missing the "school" part of CRFH, and so we're having "Elastic" as a breather, which is also drawn in a different art style. Don't worry, tho, it will only last seven days, and then we'll be back to our regular story. In the meantime, have fun.}} / Dover: [[off-panel]] As you see, finding the area of a region between two curves is SO boring and trivial.

You know Michael... he's so sentimental! / Thadeus: And is it not, Madame? / Mike's Mom: Just a while ago I inflicted a crushing humiliation on the Jones kid, and Michael didn't stop me. He only did it when he thought Blue was on the line. / Mike's Mom: It seems obvious now that Michael's just pretending to be a close friend of David, only to keep a very close eye on him! / Mike's Mom: He even brought him here with H'astur knows what excuse, knowing too well that the poor schmuck would be horribly intimidated by our wealth. / Mike's Mom: In short, Thadeus, he's doing my job!
