I think we should get Joe out of here / Hmm why / You see him over there talking with those robot fanatics The last thing we need is Joe spouting lame inside jokes we don't understand the rest of the trip / It's time to leave Joe / No / Hungry talk for you
Well thanks to Joe and his robot fetish it's too late in the day to finish our trip to Mt Rushmore tonight / So we find a hotel / Guess so / And behave yourself / Huh
Whoops / Whoops / What are you two doing down there / I know / Get off me / You first
 
Danny I need to speak with you / Yeah Mary / I'm a little worried about you and Billie You two seem to be ruled by your hormones at the moment and what if you two go too far and do something you might reg / Billie and me What Trust me Billie's the furthest thing on my mind / right Just promise me you'll think with your brain and not with your pants / Remember Sal / Sal Yeah I do We planned to wait So we waited and now she's gone / Now if you'll quit being my mother I'm going to finish packing the car
So are you and Billie gonna do the bad thing / Get off it already / There's nothing between me an' her / There won't be anything between you exactly / Just your naked bodies holding and caressing and sweating / Joe / C'mon do I need to get Mary to draw you a diagram
Get in We need to talk / Oookay / Just want to let you know what you're getting into / I'm not getting into anything / She's obviously already been around the block a few times if you know what I mean You've got standards to live up to / I do / Geez Dan Tell me you at least listened to me all these years
BOOF / Hey hey Dan / Oh no / So yer gonna score eh / No he's not He has standards and morals / Danny Listen to me You're hurting both you and her by doing this / Not likely It's consensual naughty stuff She wants it You want it / Oooo that's it / Joyce / Weird / BOOF / Gah She said the J word

SNIF SNIF WHIMPER / H hey um are you okay / Okay Fine Jus' freakin' dandy
I am so worthless you know that I swore to myself after Ruth's accident that I'd be different that I would change / It lasted a good week or so sure / I used to pride myself on how free I was I did whatever the hell I wanted No one told me what to do But now I can't stop / Freedom my ass
Perhaps this is my turning point / I thought it was my turning point too I so wanted that feeling of peace she had then / Life was so much simpler before I realized I was unhappy / I had all these personal voids I tried to fill but nothing was working / There's a dirty joke in there somewhere I think / You were almost devirginized back there weren't you Your mind'll be raunchy for days
Here's a thought / I know I can't do this change thing on my own right Well what if I had some help / I see I keep you out of trouble and away from temptation right / Heh your were doing a great job 'bout five minutes ago / Can I help it if I'm sexy
Suddenly I feel a little awkward I guess I'm not sure of where we stand / Lemme put it this way Danny / Once upon a time there was a girl who never hesitated to share herself with all sorts of guys some she liked and some she didn't / Sure she regretted the guys she didn't but she soon realized she regretted the guys she liked more Y'see she had her desserts first and didn't bother with the main course the healthy parts / Needless to say those relationships didn't last very long / And I'm not screwing up again / 'Nother words I've decided I like you too much to have sex with you / Thanks I think

Well that was a fun 9 hour drive / See you guys later I'm going home / It was a pleasure to meet you Billie
 
Billie I know Mary can be a little difficult / See also condescending rude judgemental royal pain in the # / There's a difference between doing right because it's right and doing right because it makes you special and superior / Personally I don't think Mary wants me in her elite society of do gooders / I'm her friend maybe I can talk to her about it / Danny you're her friend because you belonged to her little club

Your bus leaves soon Guess we'd better say our goodbyes / Yeah / Thank you for being open and honest / And thank you for listening and understanding / # dramatics / I guess that was a little gratuitous
 
Halt villain / Robo Vac / The one and only Enviro Mental / Or should I say Big Brother / My disguise / Now you'll think twice before kidnapping Bob Denver for peeing in the ocean / And I would've gotten away with it if it weren't for your pesky dog / Hey babe I have some clues to show you in the Mystery Van / Help Skipper / grrrr / So this is the issue where the writer started on narcotics / Hey on the next page nuns arm wrestle the Statue of Liberty

Danny But / How on earth do you rationalize this / I don't / This isn't anything I'd planned really I just feel morally numb to more things / SNAP / It's the first time that's hard After that I cared less and less / Oh no I've never cussed anyone out before and this is going to be real easy
Didn't you learn anything from what happened to you You got drunk you / What I learned is that if a life can be so irreversibly changed in one night what possible hope can I invest in / KNOCK KNOCK / There's some girl here to see you I think / # don't you females have anything better to do than give me unsolicited visits every day
Later Sal Seeya Mary / Wipe that sappy grin off your face Dan / What grin / Oh come on whenever Sal's near you I want to disown you as a pal / And I don't know what the heck you see in her She's cute but she's insane / What's wrong with insanity / Besides I think Mary's more your speed or lack thereof / Mary / But she doesn't have that oh so darlin' southern dialect / Here's a question Should I put my barf bucket to use or just bludgeon you with it
Billie What are you doing here / Um no reason / No reason You live on the other side of the state / I don't have to explain myself to you twerp / Twerp At least I'm not a stuck up little snot / Geez you two sound like an old married couple / DO NOT

Big Boss some agents are here to see you / Send them in Ms. Eables / Big Boss we / I know what you're here for / SEMME hasn't been on the level with its agents on some matters / That changes today / I had Alan send out a 411 but I suppose I'll give you the unabridged version

Joyce / Get in here Walky We need to get to know each other / LOCK / Walky You haven't called me that sinc / Hush
Mmmm / Mm / Wait wait what's going on Is this for real / Get on the bed / I don't know who you really are but yer turnin' me off / Liar / Shut up you
Y'know Walky this'd be a lot more fun if you participated / You can't be Joyce / Joyce is pure and sweet / What convincing do you need I can give you my name my birthdate anything Come on / What was college like / Short mostly I had a major crush but didn't get out much / Joyce's mind is wiped She doesn't remember college Busted / Maybe she doesn't want to
I know Joyce She'd never act like you / Then you obviously don't know me do you / Everyone's got a dark secret / I use Jason's toothbrush / Where
 
Where's Joyce imposter / Oh Walky / Remember when we went to McDonald's for Hello Kitty toys and we talked all the way home / Sal Sal Help / Unless she's joining in no
Sal Sal / Joyce pulled me into her room took off her clothes and tried to have sex with me / Hee hee hee / SNORT / hee hee hee / I'll give you 30 seconds to stop okay
I've gotta get outta here but definitely not in these clothes / How'm I gonna find anything that fits the new me / SNIP SNIP SNIP
Hello ladies / Wow are you English / Yes Yes I am / Mmm just like James Bond / Heh heh yes / Back off sluts / Joyce Shoo Go home / He's mine / Red's Scottish Beer
Isn't it past your bedtime / Mmm hmm / I've been a bad bad girl / Whatcha gonna do to me / If this is a dream I'd hate to think what is says about my subconscious / You'll just have to hate yourself in the morning
 
This is all very scary / That couldn't have been Joyce it couldn't But she knew things only Joyce could know / Ah dunno what to tell ya bro / People ain't always what they seem Even then this is purty far fetched / But if Joyce ain't Joyce / where is she
COUGH COUGH / Hey it's my special friend / I must admit that you Joyce in particular have this way of always screwing up my plans / And look Here you are pointblank at my mercy Sweet / Have I ever said how cute you are
It's a funny thing really I thought wiping your mind was a simple solution at the time / But what I assumed was some bipolar disorder of yours was really something more sinister / Heheheheheheh / What What's sinister / Heheh sorry it's just so poetic heheh
When the dup o matic inadvertently cloned you it gave a body to your second personality / What / Every naughty sexual urge you shelved in denial until those thoughts were no longer considered yours / I have no naughty thoughts / Not now All your undesired traits are now in the other you / She's not me / Okay maybe not all
This is Jason's usual pub but we're still minors sis We c / Let them stop me / Red's Scottish Beer / J Jason / Whoever that was that was not Joyce / She was here / Look all I want is a pair of pants / Ack Right
 
Just got word from SEMME Joyce just arrived in one of the SEMME crafts / Joyce Joyce / We'll go find out Let's go team / Later / Joyce / Hi / Why do you look at me that way
And the next thing I knew I got sucked out of the Steel Duck / Was it good for you / No
There are two of them / Hey everyone Hop in / Joyce / I need to feed Daniel / I just need to feed Need to feed Daniel Need to feed Daniel / Why are you all looking at me / Stop it She's not me / Stop it / I said go away / I said stop looking at me / Um
Woah there / Professor Doc We've got a problem / Leave me alone / Hey there / Okay neither of you move We're going to talk this over peacefully / Aw I like it rough / Shut up Shut up
Jason why point the gun at me / I don't know you / I'm just as much Joyce as she is I'm just the part she doesn't oblige / We're two halves of the same whole Shoot me and half of her dies / Besides I think you know me plenty if you get what I mean / Thanks for the nightmares
 
Make it go away Sal Make it go away / Aw look at the wittle baby / Now everyone knows our dark secret / But everytime you're weak you come running back to me / Lady he has a venereal disease / This is a bit rhetorical but are you insane or merely a huge hypocrite / You forgot lousy in the sack
Die / You're not me and you never will be / Not you / I'm more you than you are thanks to your repression of me The mindwipe couldn't even find me / You went to all that trouble and I'm still here / Hahahaha / Um jeez Joyce don't beat yerself up over this / Walkerton / Die / Haha / Ow
Just as always your dark side gets the better of you / But what can you do now I'm free and I'm not going away ever / You can die / BLAM

She's asleep now professor / Excellent Perhaps rest will help clear her head / I I hope so I'm beyond worried an' all She did some things I don't understand / I want to but / Yes Her recent actions conflict with your belief that she was merely a sweet girl / So instead of taking new information at face value you're trying to reconcile it with what you knew to be true / What / Right Forgot who I'm talking to / It's 4 am Walkerton I suggest you get some sleep / No / I'm staying here / SEMME
 
You didn't have to stay / I know / She's been sleeping for 18 hours / How about I watch over for a bit / I'm fine here / Very well / Do a deer a female deer
Walkerton certainly likes Joyce a lot / Everyone knows but Joyce of course / But now / This is way too much for him to handle / He really needs to find someone else But ah sure ain't tellin' him that / I'm sure Mike would be glad to / Wow We've found a use for him
I got it I got it / Move I'm going to smash the spider / Hey it's just a bug / Bug / I'll have you know spiders are arachnids not insects / If ya can smash 'em they're bugs / That's not how it works / Hey Jason I found someone as anal as you
I figger everything fits into five major groups / There's birds bugs hairy things monkeys and people And uh fish So six / Pretty efficient huh / TWITCH / You like
Your education was sorely lacking / Yeah it rules / Bro / Where's Joyce / Hey she's / Uh oh
 
JOYCE
Whew That was close / Walky you idiot / Idiot I saved you / Why don't you just leave me alone This is what I want okay / I hate you / I waited for you And you treat me like this / No mindwipe for you / Ever / Wait / BOINK / Yeah well if that broke it would've been really cool
Walkerton Joyce How'd you get in here without authorization / Uh
And then Walkerton jumped in and stopped me from using it / Is that true / I have nuffin' to say / That's refreshing / Walkerton wait / You're staying right here Joyce where we can keep an eye on you / Walky
Hey you What's yer name / Dina / Are you psychotic or weird or deranged in any way / I'm a scientist / I 'spose I could overlook that Wanna be my girl
 
Hi Walkerton / I'd just like to say that me an' my girlfriend are gonna go eat somewhere Me an' my girlfriend say goodnight / Ya always hurt the ones ya love / Yeah
Ah told her / Why couldn't Joyce talk to us about her feelings before they got out of hand / She's lost so much / Hey a girl's got to have her secrets / But at what cost
Maybe ah should start followin' my own advice / Oh / Like Joyce ah don't want my ghosts exposed to the world But then they sit an' rot an' grow / An' ah know a willin' listener
Here Dina Take a seat / Thank you / Are ya comfortable / Yes / Geez what does it take to get some service 'round here / Isn't this Taco Bell / It's cheaper than food / TRASH
Did you wash your face
 
Pumpkin / Let go a' me / Ya wanted to talk so here ah am okay / Ah'll tell you every sordid detail of my life My secret Just promise me / Cut out the mother stuff when ah get to the sex / Are you on the pill
For the longest time ah've been consumed with bein' objective and consistent / But ah keep gettin' this naggin' in the back of my noggin no matter how deep ah hide it / Just this week ah've seen such repression destroy a sweet innocent girl / Drove her to murder / So here it is the whole load Why ah am who ah am

What's wrong with you recently You're not fun anymore / Fun / Maybe Mary ah'm sick of bein' fun an' whenever ah act how ah feel people get pissy / Pissy / But screw them Ah'm sick of bein' who ah'm not / Not that you'd understand / Of course not
 
Ah don't belong here Goodbye Mary / Huh / Well whatever / Ah'll just go home an' tell pa that the only damn way ah'm movin' is at gunpoint / You're going with me
I know this looks bad but I must get you away from here / Yer freakin' me out / Stop it / GAK / PUNT / Oooo who's wearin' the hat now / Give that back
If you value your life you'll come with me / Well thats purty rhetorical ain't it / Ah've got the best damn life in the world / Ah've got parents who couldn't care less a so called best friend who wouldn't know strife if it bit her on the ass an' everythin' ah hold dear is always ripped away from me / So why do ah bother / Hold that thought Danno It's Sal / And she doesn't sound too good
A ah'm back / How dare you Do you have any idea what we're going through / Mother / Martha You hit her / John she refuses to learn / Get in the truck Sal
It's chilly Put this on and don't argue / Let's go John / How long can we do this / Do what / Uproot our family at the whims of a man we don't even know / She'll understand someday / Ah wish she'd hurry up

Oh sure Save your folks / You'll go back to the same old life you hate so much But now you have the chance to walk away No more parents No more pain / Follow me Your parents will go on Escape your hell / Good idea / But ah follow no one
So that's how it's gonna be huh Your parents may only have some bumps and scratches now but I can top that believe me / See if ah care / Okey dokey
 

As you wish / But / But / Ah didn't / Don't give me that I even got you on tape / See if ah care / Busted / But what does it matter now You'll hardly side with me will you / Oh well / Say hello to your new mommy and daddy
Rule #1 / Oof / Don't piss off the alien / Rule #2 / I always get what I want / Rule #3 I have no room to talk as far as selfishness is concerned / But at least I'm not a whiney bitch about it
Yeah that's it Just enough mind wiper to / Ah A Man in Black / Sal Run / Ah A Man in Black and Blue / Hey in moments like these you take what humor you can
COUGH COUGH / You Men in Black are expendable aren't you / Sal Throw the hovercraft / D'oh
 
The fact that ah effortlessly threw a hovercraft was farthest from my mind / Ah just wanted to get as far away as possible / Ah grabbed my bag an' my ma's coat / It was gonna be chilly from then on
After a few more run ins with the aliens ah finally made it to Danny's university Ah wanted to collapse in his arms tell him ever'thing But as soon as he opened that door ah was my old self / Ah couldn't do that to Danny Gettin' his bike stolen turned his world upside down My parents' murder destroyed mine Our problems were separated by orders of magnitude how could he possibly understand / Understand is the wrong word More like comprehend Ah couldn't stay with him an' not just 'cuz aliens were trailin' me He simply couldn't comprehend How could anyone
Six months later / TAXI / Meet me back here at 6 okay / Mom sure flew us out here on such short notice huh Beef / Grunt / What sorta old friend can she have in Denver / Moms don't get to have lives They get to clean an' cook / Grunt / Yeah an' wipe our butts

Don't worry I've got troops watching them / Anthony / What happened to my wife I will not let that happen to your family / Shhh On the count of three I'll honk the horn really loud
HONK / Hey that was just rude / Caution / I'm going to wipe the floor with you / Geez who are you the noise police / I told you we'd get beat up if we wore these things in public
Why Tony You're still alive / You'd think that after last week you wouldn't want to be but I'm not the glutton for punishment / I guess I should've seen that coming
 
Remember Big Boss wants him alive / Right / Hooks you round up Ms Walkerton's kids / At least one of them has to be an abductee / Who are you people / People who're tired of their lives being #ed with
BLAM / I see how it is I roughen you up and you get your poss after me / Ah ain't nobody's poss / We're all in this together / 'Cept for him / Yankee bigots

Good night troops Great work today / Hi honey / You beat me down again / You know me Ah never waste my time / I can't complain / So do you really have a meeting or was that just yer codeword for a roll in the hay / Well I thought I'd dignify it with some dinner first / EAT AT
So what first attracted you to me / Your hair / What about you / Yer eyes / They seemed so sad but you were so strong outside / See There it is again
Ah hate nosey people more than anythin' but ah care so much fer you / An' it eats me up inside not to know / Ah know somethin' terrible happened to your mother / Whatever happened ah want to help / Look you carry my burden an' ah'll carry yours / Boy was ah stupid
Ah promised ah'd keep his story a secret / An' ah still keep that promise / His story was awful inconceivable and disgusting / An' why ah had to kill him when ah did / So now ah carry both our burdens on an ever growing list
My parents Tony the head alien stole them all from me / An' both times it was by my own doing / Ah was ready to kill the head alien an' myself with him / Thankfully Walkerton stopped me / Like before ah was led by what ah wanted It killed my folks / But it wasn't gonna take me / Ah'd received my punishment an' it's my duty to live with it / No shortcuts
 
It sounds you've been through a lot / Nothin' ah didn't deserve / You know I think you just need to let go / No / Then telling me your past helped nothing / Then ah'm sorry fer wastin' yer time / Wait
You have to stop punishing yourself / I know what happens when you put all your mental eggs in one basket / You go crazy / Yes / That's exactly what ah'm preventin' / Ah choose my beliefs an' stick to 'em / Learnin' from your mistakes
Oh Joy oyce / Yeah / No no in here / Huh / I'm in your mind / NOOOO / WHAP / Ow / WHAP / Ow / WHAP / Ow / WHAP / Ow
I can't believe it Three whole months How does Dina stand him / SEMME / Oh well We can only hope she's a good influence on him / Wiigii / It hurts right here
So Dina How are Walkerton and you doing / Nicely / You do seem happy How do you do it / Hey Dina I found this cool bug in my sandwich so / I am impressed / munch munch munch
 
Who knew a relationship on the rebound would work / Walkerton an' Dina / Yes I'd thought Walkerton was just being petty at Joyce / But they actually work together / smooch / Later sweetums / Though some things I'll never get used to
Dina's great ain't she / What's so great about her / Um / It's cute how she empties her sinuses violently when she showers in the morning / I did not have this conversation / Where's the mind wiper
Ah hope you're disgusted with yourself / What Why / Dina's just a replacement for you know who / No I don't know who / Joyce / Joyce Do I know a Joyce Hmm Nope Doesn't ring a bell
Of course I'm the only responsible one here / DOG CHOW / Mike and Sal are always gloomy and I know I'm not Mr. Exciting / What we need are some smiles around here / Joyce you're our squadron's soul / We need you back
SMOOCH / Oh no Body temperature rising / Talk about bad car ma / That sounded like some nightmare / Yeah I mean that was the worst pun ever
 
How's Joyce doing Why has she made no progress / Big Boss we can't afford to fix her / Do you know how many times she's saved the world's collective ass with her psychotic outbursts / Three / Well I'm holding out for five
This is a very crucial time professer we have dozens of squads out hoping to beat the aliens to the martian ruins / Exactly why we need Joyce the way she is / If you won't treat her we'll find someone who will / No Hooper
Great news everyone Joyce is coming home / Oh good now I can be murdered in the comfort of my own home / Yeah I love being verbally abused / That's exactly what I don't want / I'll tolerate no negative comments / Hey Joyce you sure were a good lay / You were cool when you were normal / Children
SEMME / Keep in mind that they're giving Joyce sex related objects / They're hoping that she'll become relaxed around the subject / So no snickering / No matter what / Lookit these cute curling irons / Abject horror is allowed / BZZZZZZZZ / Wheeee
Um Joyce those ain't curling irons / I I guess I knew that / Ah'll uh take those out fer you / Good 'cuz I can't move
 
Feel good to be home Joyce / Not really / The apartment reeks of blood and sailors / Semen / Whatever
I kind of like your new hairstyle / What / It's nicer with it thinner on top / thanks / It really brings out your huge monkey ears
Maybe we should all go out and do somethin' together / To lift Joyce's spirits Sounds superb / Plus we never celebrated me an' Walkerton's 21st birthday so / There's a reason / Walkerton an' alcohol / We have a hard enough time making him piss inside the bowl as it is
Hey whassup / We're goin' out / Aw cute 'Bout time you two hooked up / Not that Just to the pub / Boozin' up my sis huh You inhuman predator / No We're all going / Good gosh man A lil' optimistic are we / Very optimistic / Well thanks
Everyone comfortable / We'd like 5 Red's Scottish Beers and one Coke please / Actually / I'll have what they're having
 
Joyce are you certain you want a beer / We're not asking you to do anything you don't want to / I'm sure / Okay not so sure anymore
Bleah Bitter sour buttcheese / I paid ten lousy dollars for this / What a ripo / Wo
One sip / Yes And he's on the floor / Jashon is that you old friend / My time in the light is short
I don't know what I'm doing Sal / I've always defined myself relative to my peers / I knew who I was and how I fit in / But who I am is wrong and damaging I've done terrible things / so I must conform to keep myself and others from harm / But that erases who I am my identity / I don't want to save myself by destroying what makes me unique / However that's the punishment I have to accept for being evil / Though hopefully I'll prove able to hold my liquor better than you and your brother
Too much beer / I'm okay but I don't think the room is / Hang in there / Yer so good to me / Did I ever tell you how beautiful you are / Almost as beautiful / as Joyce
 
No no You don't think that anymore / You don't mean that You love me / Mine
Still pondering over your beer / Pondering over whether to get another one / Okay okay No more for me
Dina why did you ask fer me / Well / I need to ask you something / Last night while you were passed out / God dammit That was just a nap
So Walkerton likes Joyce more than you Ah'd just dump 'im / No I love him / Why you of all people would be attracted to / You know how he stares blankly / At first I thought he was braindead or something but it's just that he's always thinking / Constantly / He's the most intelligent man alive / and only I appreciate him
So tell me Sal Do you really think he meant it / All ah can say is that Walkerton liked Joyce fer a really long time / All right / Thank you / Why do people always come to me with their problems / SEMME / You know not to whom you speak
 
What was that for / You should be 'shamed of yerself / What / You told Dina Joyce is prettier than her when you were drunk last night / I did not / Ah'm not the one who needs convincing Dina's home crying because of your stupid ass / Maybe this will blow over in the morning / Maybe you need another whack
Where you headed / I gotta talk to Dina / What about / Oh y'know / stuff / You think I'm beautiful
Stop before you blurt out No and run away just sit with me / We haven't talked since forever so talk to me / Honestly / Please / Do I have to
So you liked me as more than a friend and never told me / Why / I guess / I was afraid of what you'd say / What if you laughed at me and said No I hate you / Walky / I would have said yes
You like me Joyce / Yes I'm so sorry I got mad at you over the mind wiper / Oh my gosh this is sooo cool / Yay go us / what / Dina
 
You'd better go talk to Dina / Yeah I know / Want me to go with you / No no I think that'd be bad
Walkerton Hi / Hi Dina / I wasn't expecting you this afternoon / Sit down and I'll go get some nachitos / Jurassic
Walkerton you're trembling / A am I / Yes what's wrong / I / Dina you're so good to me / Don't let me take you fer granted ever again
Joyce / I should have known better than to think I was wanted / Uh okay
Somewhere in the Atlantic / There has got to be a more efficient way to find Martian ruins / Monkey Master you're the one You make bathtime lots of fun Monkey Master I'm awfully fond of you / Stop that
 
These Martian scanners are worthless / Boss maybe we should try the sensitive scanner / Absolutely not / But it's their most sensitive equipment / Ohh fine / You won't understand me You won't / As user friendly as ever eh
Look scanner don't give me more Melotian crap okay I want Martian M A R T I A N Got it / whimper / You don't love me / It's like talking to a woman / Oh like you'd know / Quiet wench / Sensitive Scanner 1 Head Alien 0
I don't care if we never find Martian ruins I'm never using the Sensitive Scanner again / scratch scratch / You look simply stunning today / I'm all yours sweetie
At long last / The exact coordinates of the old Martian empire's Earth hub / Unseen by most for over 10000 years / Up ahead / the embassy building gateway to the empire / and all the lethal enforcement that entails
Hrm DNA access codes are required for the shield perimeter to power down / Blast it / SPLUDGE / Eyew Blue bloated soggy monkeys / I told you there's a leak in my ammo chamber
 
Blast The embassy is impenetrable We need the proper DNA access codes / That means we need an able Martian which is impossible / Unless / SEMME squadrons are patrolling the area in great numbers / Yes / For once let's draw attention to ourselves / Yeah we know how little you like attention
And so / When did this search mission become a battlefield / Fitz couldja get over here / On my way Lith / Squad 37 regroup / Whoa hey / Hi / No I don't want to die a vir / Now that I've got your attention
Why did the raptors in Jurassic Park III have spikes on 'em / Feathers / Recently discovered fossil imprints show that dinosaurs were covered in down feathers like birds / Dinosaurs aren't 'sposed to be fuzzy / Sorry but there's no way around it / Bleh / Science would be cool if it weren't for all the stupid facts
RARRR / That's my lil' dino / RARR / RARR / RARR / Rarr
So what are we here for / Ask Big Boss / We just got this from squad 37 / The aliens just showed up killed Hooper an' left / Max Tony and Zack went after them / This whole thing reeks of a setup SEMME central Damn their testosterone / They're probably all dead
 
Squad 128 you're my best team / Odds are the aliens found the Martians / Professor is Joyce ready to join them / Absolutely / Dina You're less biased / Huh / Is she stable / No
Big boss / Quiet Joyce / Well 128 you're short a member Who can fill her spot / I will / Dina Aren't you a pacifist / A Scientist / I want to expand my knowledge in the field of explodology / That's really grasping but since you're trying so hard
Squad 128 you're to rendezvous with the rest of the squads already patroling the Bermuda triangle / Here the spot squad 37 last hailed from / Dress for tropics / The professor's team and myself will accompany you / You Big Boss Why / We're dealing with Martians Jason I'm one of two people alive who's ever seen one of them
The Bermuda triangle / Isn't it a bit warm for that jacket / No / These are the coordinates where I lost the others / My condolences Lith / Get ready troops Even though the Martians are gone doesn't mean it's all nicey nice down there / I wonders what he's thinking of / wedgie
Oh my god I found Zack / He's cut raht in two / Monkey Master couldn't do that / Uh oh
 
Big Boss this is 128 and 135 We found Zack both halves of him / I'll send Squad 98 to your position / Squad 98 / Squad 98 Where are you / I'll be right there / Did we use up our uh oh quota

Walkerton I'm so glad we're okay / Dina ya might've thought it'd be fun to hang around but keep in mind that our mission comes first Always / Don't expect us to haul yer ass outta trouble / You were lucky this time / I don't think your sister likes me / You prolly shouldn't hug me I've peed myself
Heave / Thanks 128 / Glad to help / Sis / Sis I know arguing with you won't change your mind so I'm going to tickle you until you agree to help Dina along / Ah'm not ticklish / Ah told you ah'm not stop it / Itchy goo / Ah said / Yer smiling / Fine You win

Ah swear if you've touched anything down here / Why Sal / I didn't know you cared I mean / See if ah care / See now you're overcompensating
Ah'll kill you / Is my name Tony / Sal stop Hold on / He's obviously provoking you He wants you to chase him for whatever reason / Are you sure / Ooh spank me Spank me

Whoa who slow down now / We're here / Wait hold up Just hear me out okay / We're on the verge of the greatest civilization that ever lived The Martians could do it all span galaxies restructure their DNA even bring back the dead / But no one can get in The entire city is shielded past this embassy And I need help / So / This is going to be uncharacteristically kind of me
Your parents
 
Let me elaborate / 25 years ago your real mother killed off the Martians / She had to have gotten inside right And that's a no no without the proper DNA / I don't know how but she must have restructured her own body chemistry to get access / She's hidden from me but you / You might do the trick
So here's my offer Using Martian tech I'll resurrect your parents / All you have to do is get me in / That's it
Well Is it a deal / Disgusting / They have been dead for three years Sal / Sal / No but ya get her understudy
Walkerton But / Whoops huh / How / Her jacket a lil' seaweed voila / It is kinda hard to move like she does / But then / it's in my blood
His fist smells like / snif snif / lonely / grunt / splat / Are you sure Walkerton's all right / Shut up an' shoot somethin'

You and Joyce were on our ship for a routine checkup / But you managed to get loose you little devils We chased you all over until we finally got her / We announced over the loudspeaker that if you didn't show we'd hurt the girl / And you didn't / No you hid Despite her pleas you found a dark corner and covered your ears / Mindwipes erase the event but not the echoes of her screams across your conscience / So go ahead Make a fart joke Plead ignorance Avoid the pit your sister fell in long ago pretend to / Huh / Walky / Where'd he go
SNAP / Uh oh / SNAP / Ever'one duck fer cover / The ceilin's gonna

Sal's parents / She's freakin' out We gotta get her outta here / Ah'm sorry / I'm not even sure that'll help / Ah'm so sorry / Do you really think she's our top priority right now / We don't have time to argue Everyone able help those who aren't / Grunt / Head for the entrance

Denver / Happy new year / 2000 / Here comes the countdown / Get ready / Five / Four / Three / Woah headache / Two / Geez / ONE / Aaaaaaaaaa
Several years ago I began a campaign to prepare myself an army of this planet's inhabitants Minor setbacks occured but nonetheless a fraction of Earth's population was fated to be mine / The natives caught wind of my quest for power but not my means Creating a force to stop me consisting of minds I myself reprogrammed is the highest irony Their loyalty waited but for the chosen time / And that time is now None remain to oppose me in this new hour a new beginning / Year Zero
Such wonderful silence my friends Nearly all of SEMME is lying inoperative on their floors / Neato / Now the real work begins And my timing is perfect Humans everywhere are expecting apocalypse at the new millennium / So deliciously I've began my coup one year early in human year 2000 A.D. taking them unawares / Um boss / What
 
To my airship / SEMME / Where we going oh almighty leader / The abductees are awaiting my command but I have to acquire the controls first / Where are the controls / Back in 1984 I Enough convenient Q and A sessions What am I a Bond villain
Tony Beef Mike Wake up / This is alarming / It's like they just dropped limp / Well we haven't a moment We'll need to run our chums into H.Q. / or drag in Beef's case / Sal Where's Sal / If I make any Y2K bug puns feel free to thrash me / Y2K bug / Right your mind was wiped wasn't it This gets better and better all the time
I'll unlock our craft Good thing we flew one in / Nuh uh uh / The blazes / Greetings this is the head alien speaking / If you're hearing this message you're probably one of the few agents who slipped through my fingers Nonetheless the SEMME central computer is now controlled by me Heh / The holidays are depressing enough / Yaw w wn / How about we take a quick nap
Proper procedure calls for an assessment of our current situation / Okay / Most of our squad is comatose or missing and SEMME central computer is under alien control / Yeah / You're new right Got the handbook on person / The So now you're a secret agent manual / Yes Look around in the index / Q I am denied access to SEMME central functions What should I do / A SEMME central is infallible There must be a problem with the user
There must be a logical way to go about this / SEMME handbook / Chapter 14 Problem solving in a period of crisis / If the head alien's wrested control of SEMME central computer he's most likely escaped We'll have to track him down / Refer to data in SEMME central before continuing / But first we'll have to assess damages back at SEMME H.Q. / If SEMME central is not responsive see page 923 / Don't suppose you owned a car in your previous life / SEMME central is infallible There must be a problem with the user
 
Here's a venture there's got to be a few SEMME agents still conscious sitting around upstairs / This is SEMME's downtown living quarters after all many of their personnel are under this roof / Year / DING / Hey suit guy you've got a lot of nose hair / Bloody hell
You trying to give me a heart attack / I'm gonna drop at midnight / It's been midnight for minutes you / Aw poo Really / Yes Now do you have a car we can use / I don't know You'll have to ask Mr. Belly Button / What / Help help I'm choking There's too much lint in my mouth
Do you have a car or not / Only Mr. Belly Button knows for sure / Certainly When I'm dead and gone / Mr. Belly Button do you have a car / Parking garage level 4C black 1986 Dodge Ram here's the keys
So do you need help down / Nah I got it Joyce / How do you know my name / You dunno me / Should I / I was there when you woke up / Oh I don't remember much from those first few days
It's really weird y'know not having any memories / Am I the same person I was before What am I supposed to be like / Does anyone miss me / I would / But then I say to heck with it this life is fun / GIGGLE
 
Blast Everyone here is out cold / Perhaps if we / Oh It's you / See here we've got very important matters so if y / He's got a car Jason Can't he come along / Ew no / C'mon he's got to be somewhat useful Got any skills / I eat and sleep well
I refuse to be accompanied by this backwards little boy / I'm almost twenty / Think about it Jason It's two of us against possibly hundreds of aliens We have no SEMME central and no aircraft We need all the help we can get / Oh very well / Wiigii / I'll go get my pick up / Pick up But
Here she is / How charming / I'll be making myself at home back here I assume / Lemme open the door fer ya / Thankies / When we save the world I expect ample compensation for this travesty / SCREEEEEEEEEEEE / Bloody / Sorry about the music I've only got AM radio / Yodel ay ee Yodel ay ee Yodel ay ee / AAAAAAAAAAA
Now load up the others in the back We can't hardly leave them out here / Urgh Beef's heavy / Hey my brother / Beef is your brother / Yeah my twin / So I'm short / If I were your family I'd starve you to death too
That leaves us with the aircraft We need a way to hide it / Right on it chief / Oh god / The sad thing is that he's proud of this
 
Meanwhile back at SEMME H.Q. / Ah my airship / SEMME / Now that the SEMME central computer is down I won't even need a security code to release the magnetic bonds / Then it's an easy task to fly to our base activate the mind control device after which hundreds of human subjects will serve me / Step away from the aircraft Head Alien / Oh it's only you
I'm disappointed Big Boss I was expecting the girl / I said step away / Where's the rest of your staff Big Boss Professor Doc Alan / I don't recall abducting them / But I do recall securing the building for any stragglers
What's worth more to you Me or your entire remaining staff I assure you my countless subordinates can and will carry on without me as they have for the past half year / Raise it a little higher / The boss is comin' back / Quick Hide the latex gloves and puppies / nuclear warhead
Fine head alien I'll let you go if my staff goes free / What the heck sure / It's not as if you can stop me once I'm gone anyway / You humans sure are stupid
The head alien told us to keep a few hostages What's a couple less / Heheh / Have we considered melee weapons
 
Glad to see us / I am / Not victims of the virus I see / Virus / The reason everyone's unconscious you doof / I thought it was 'cuz it's one o'clock in the morning / Can I strangle him / No / Glad in a very loose sense mind
In the time since our agents have shut down we've discovered the nature of the virus / Professor / Certainly Big Boss The vast majority of our agents are also past victims of alien experiments Why is still classified / It's because abductees have an affinity with alien technology / How'd you / You can find anything on the internet
The aliens left a sort of timer in their abductees' minds forcing them asleep at the appointed time / You three were spared obviously because you were volunteers or your mind was wiped in the female's case / So when do we kick alien butt / You're not going anywhere Walkerton / Extreme situations do not call for simpleminded fools / You're staying here
But I wanna help / We're losing time Walkerton / Let it go / Agents you'll be accompanied by Alan our alien expert / Quick give me a synonym for expert that begins with A / Huh
We've managed to pinpoint the location of the aliens' base of operations If our information's correct we can find and destroy them / Now if we're ready / We have some important business ahead of us / Turn around

Well you both bring up interesting points / Um / Wrong answer
Billie what's the deal with putting me on the spot like that / On the spot nothing Either you trust me or we have no business talking / Mary is a long time friend okay I can't just turn on her / If she's a prime example of one of your friends I don't suppose that speaks well for me
I'm sorry Billie / I've had enough I'm going home Danny / But / Don't you understand / I don't need beer I'm past that now I wanted to tell you that / But you took a dump all over that soon enough / sigh / Tell me / Do you really consider me a liar or do you just not have the balls to speak your mind

Hey Billie Yeah we're packing up for winter break / It's a long drive but / Joe / Get down from there / Aw / Think of the consequences / Well I'll find a girl strip our clothes and have wild powerful sex / Consequences are stacked pretty high in my favor / Be careful okay / Roger / AAAAAAAA / As it's been said it's a lot easier going down than comin' up / Come help me you insensitive bastard / THE END

You are that Joyce that Danny talked about aren't you / Danny talks about me Wow / And didn't I see you running out from here crying before / Yeah / Was that when Joe said Teddy Ruxpin wasn't real or when Joe taped bugs to my hair / Or was it when he set fire to my Lion King tape Perhaps when he peed on my bursar bill
Hey What's she doing here / I have no idea I was coming up the elevator and she was there Honest / Listen if you want to ditch here I understand I'll fake an illness or something and / I was talking about you / Oh I'm here 'cuz I'm lonely Hold me
Good lord this is sickening / You're just jealous / Joyce hush Go back home Ruth and I have plans / Awwww / See you in class tomorrow / God just stop / I said I'd leave / POW
Why the heck did you hit me / You deserve it / I don't know which is worse her stalking you or you leading her on like that / You're just as much at fault for this as she is probably more / In fact I think you like it / What Stop this / No no Please do continue
 
Answer me this Danny / If indeed you don't want Joyce to bother you why continue to even speak with her / We're friends Pals / Uh huh Is that between flirts or straight through / My point is not only are you being totally dishonest to this girl but you keep her around because the loves you / Not anymore / What did I ever do to you Ruth
Danny I liked you because you were moral and good and pure perfect / but you're not You're just a phoney like everyone else / Goodbye / Y'know she has some real strict criteria / Considering yours is must be southern troubled and named Sal I think you're reaching
You're angry with me / You could say that I don't like Joyce She's psycho / That's precisely why you like her She's not boring to say the least Same with everyone you know / Your best friend is everything you hate your ex girlfriend was as zany as Joyce / Another dubious friend has a mean left hook / Sorry a case of the tail wagging the dog
I don't know what to say to you Ruth / In the past month you've alienated me from two good friends / Is our friendship doing any good Why are we friends / Because we can talk How often do you have intelligent conversation with Joe / The trick is you're nearly the exact way I was when I was your age I grew up being the mature one I thought I had things figured out / Great now I'm real optimistic for the future / I figure any day now your parents will divorce
I'm never speaking to Danny ever again / Oh Do tell / I thought he was perfect but he's not / Ah well Glad to see a moment of brilliance from you / Of course / Oh no / I bet that ex girlfriend of his corrupted him That tramp / That didn't last long
 
Sometimes I wonder if girls will look at me and say Ack Look at that lousy dork / And then I remember my competition / so that's why Picard is the best captain Sisko and Janeway losers I've also started watching more public television Nova is such a great
What's on / Some has been movie A real snore Only thing on though / The key to watching these is to interact with them / Now Howard whenever a guy says a line to a babe we finish his sentence out loud with Now let's get naked / Wow You rule so much / Stick with me kid and I'll learn ya
ssssssss / YAWN / Eww Gross Shower drain hair / But all the other showers are occupied / sssssss / It's unfair to have such a big crisis this early in the morning
I hafta get the hair out of the drain without touching it / Maybe if I use my towel no I have to touch the towel later / Hmm If I use my conditioner and deodorant to pick it off the ground Now where do I put it / Hey
I think that's the last of the ickies / Finally I can take my shower and get ready for class / Now let's get naked / If you say that one more time while Bette Midler is onscreen
 
Hey there / Hey Billie Brought some Nachitos / Ooh yay / Where's Ruth / She went to get more food for the party / You mean beer / Duh I'm not old enough to get it myself / But / nevermind Being the good kid is getting on my own nerves / Took the words right out of my mouth
Hmph Tell me where being responsible has gotten me / No where / RRRR / Where has being moral and honest taken me / No where / RRRRRR / My girlfriend's gone my friends abandoned me and life sucks Where does that leave me / No where / After all the / Excuse me but my cheerleading years weren't that dear to me so if you'd kindly stuff it
I'm sorry about ranting Billie I guess I'm just tired / Tired of everything / Oh cut the dramatics Stop thinking so much and just do what you feel like / Beer You feel like having a beer / Can't I just rip the tags off of seat cushions or something relatively safe and mild
I don't know if I should do th / I thought you said you didn't care about anything any more / Well no but isn't this erm the last one / No and Ruth's bringing more / Plus I'm only 20 so it's illegal / Only if you buy it / Expiration date / It's beer / Liver damage Hey / I need this to make you tolerable
Hello I'm back / Carly Where is everyone / In the back / Hey what's up / pfffphthppthh / Heh / Hee hee hee / Danny you're drunk / SLAP / Go get me more beer
 
Danny you're drunk How could you / They made me Honest / But you've always been so decent / Like # I was I was a tight # / Your language / Yeah I say # and # too / Hey I'm just trying to fit in
Danny this is unacceptable Give me that / Listen to me you've got to / Hey Where'd you / Show me both hands / Anyway Danny you've got to / gain control / shkss
Danny listen to me / If you've got problems this isn't the way to solve them You need to attack the infection not ignore it / Giving up is never the answer to life's struggles / It's yours / Ouch / Score
We're outta beer / I'll get some / This is my fault / Danny just ran out the door / I've destroyed him / No wait He's back And he grabbed your keys / By my example / I think he's taking your car / And now now I make amends
Lemme borrow your car I'm going after Danny / Are you crazy He already left What do you plan to do / Stop him of course / Well that's a terribly smart thing to do / But it's the right thing to do / For once I want to wake up in the morning and be proud of my actions / Perhaps this is my turning point / Here be noble in Ron's car / Thank you Billie
 
God Ron is such a slob / Where's the / VROOM / Ahh there / That's my car alright This may be easy / Though I suppose it'd be easier if I had a plan
Almost got 'im / Now I guess I roll my window down and try to get him to pull over / Looks like I made the right decision after all Do what's right no matter the / SCREECH / Hmm
No / That truck just sped out of control hit the divider / HONK HONK / SCREEEEE / Danny / Danny Swerve / Dammit / Hmph / My parents are gonna kill me
Act with integrity / No regrets

 
Doo dee doo Mister Fuzzy Wuzzy Bear can sit up here / Does Bunny Wunny want to play with Mr. Bear / Dinner winner Why I'd be delighted / Sarah Warah's gonna bash in Joyce's heady weddy / Time to put on Mr. Helmet
Joyce why aren't you over bothering Danny instead of me / Well / after last year and all the horrible stuff I did y'know stalking him telling my folks we're engaged / How do I even begin to talk to him / So basically you can't confront him 'cuz now he knows you're a psycho / Exactly
Now Joyce if yer trying to attract Danny you're doing a terrible job / The problem is there's nothing to you You flitter around talk about boys and you have no depth Get a hobby be interesting / Get rid of the plush animals / Awwww
Hello / Hmm / Oh It's you / Yeah I'm having trouble with my roommate / And why do I care / He scares me y'see Very frightening I can't talk to him / I'd appreciate some help or some advice or something I guess / I don't care The door is that way Leave now / He seems to stop growling when I bring him raw meat
Hey Joe Look / What now / It's in my room next door / What is / My new state of the art computer
 
Joe I was talking to Howard next door this morning / He was backed up into the corner and well twitching / I tried to reason with him but when I mentioned your name his face was suddenly consumed with some unspeakable horror / Heheheheheheheheheheh / Joe leave the kid alone
Whoa Little Howard has a girl in his room / Wow / Nevermind she's his sister / Ahh / Hold up she's his cute sister / Oh no
Hey hey Howard My man You didn't tell me you have a cute sister / Why hello there I'm a friend of your brother / Omph / Are you the kid who's been picking on Howard / Picking on is kind of harsh Just a little fun really No harm d / POW
Aw geez my wrist / Your wrist What about my nose / Freakin' punched me in the friggin' nose Crap / Man this is gonna hurt for days / PUNT / Shaddup
Danny I need your help Howard's sis is beating me up / So what do you want me to do / I dunno that thing / You mean that thing where I talk to females as real human beings instead of as a source for sex on demand / Yeah That weird thing / In a more perfect world that'd be the rule rather than the exception
 
Ah hello I'm Danny from next door / Oh Hi there / Howard / Don't worry he's the nice one / Oh / Can I hit him anyway / Just don't scuff up my Star Trek commemorative plate
Well Joe I talked with Howard's sister / And / Actually we hit it off rather well Her name is Ruth and we're doing something this weekend / Alright Dan You're the man / The relationship is purely platonic Joe / Then what's the point
It's so inspiring to be in such an institute for higher learning / The educational possibilities are limitless I'm glad my tuition money is well spent / Instead of the normal lecture I thought we'd enjoy a guest speaker on the topic of the importance of studying / Eh who am I kidding
Why are you taking me to the library / Joyce you need a hobby Trust me / You seem awful nice by helping me though and you're never nice to me Sarah / Yeah well / I figger if I make you more interesting Danny boy'll like you and you'll be gone more often See / You're not one for subtle hostilities are you / Hey a book on Japan You could get an internship
While we're looking for a hobby for you Joyce is there anything you're interested in / Um well / Danny's a wholesome kinda guy so hmmm Heh Cross stitching / And Body Piercing at Home is out of the question right Joyce / Joyce / Lookit a book on aliens / I want to make you more interesting Joyce but not that interesting
 
Okay Joyce so far we've got 2 books on marine life you took to those well / Then we found this book on ponies I'll take that back very quickly thank you / But I'm worried about your sudden interest in aliens so erm / Oh my god / What
I'm outta here Joyce You're scarin' me with all this aliens stuff / But / But nothing Yer molding aliens out of your dorm food It's frightening / There is no one on this campus as sick and deranged as you / Oh my gosh / What
YAWN / So how's George today / Cindy / I really wish he hadn't given a name to my single chest hair
Danny I'm glad you came / Guys this is Danny / I'm Ron / Billie / I'm Carly / I'll be upstairs for a bit Talk amongst yourselves I'm sure you have lots in common / Who wants a beer / Me / Me
Well this is delightful I'd better excuse myself / Woo hoo hooo / Hic / Giggle / What a waste / Hey Danny Where you going / Ruth your friends are drunken jerks / Hey those are my drunken jerk friends
 
How can you call those people your friends Ruth / Easily / Sure they're all drunk now but there's more to them than that / They use other drugs / No For example Carly over there she kept me sane during my parents' divorce / What about the guy / Oh you're right about him He's a drunken jerk
Every weekend we all get together and throw caution to the wind / Y'know a few days to say to hell with it and forget the consequences / Yeah but the consequences still exist / But it all depends on whether you care about the consequences or not / Ah
Ruth what you're telling me is terrible don't you have any hopes or dreams at all / I used to Danny / But it seems that I've systematically lost all my principles one by one until I've been stripped bare of any meaning / Why are you telling me this / Well you look like you have your act together and I want to know how / Duct tape
The truth is I don't have my act together / You begin to entertain all sorts of self doubt when your girlfried of 2 years suddenly shows up and announces she's running away / I mean apparently I went wrong somewhere And I still don't know what's happened to her / Danny if this is the least of your worries / And I want to know how the heck she got into my 3rd floor window
Well you're back late / Yeah Long night / Ruth's party started out as a big drink fest between her roommates but she's really depressed and looking for advice / Beer and chicks and you have a conversation / Am I the only man alive who doesn't think with his loins / Yes / Did someone say beer and chicks
 
I have a feeling this is gonna degenerate into sentimental crap I'm leaving / Humor me Howard and listen to a tale of a boy and his girlfriend / Was she beautiful / Danny she talks like Andie MacDowell / Yeah / That wasn't a compliment
Sal was the sort of person you either loved or hated / She was filled with such boundless energy and wit people were either annoyed or drawn to her charisma / I hope you don't mind me venting all this at you Howard / That's okay I'm just not used to doing anything on a Friday night
Unfortunately Sal showed up at my dorm last year but she wasn't right Soon after she left and I haven't heard from her since / There's a reason I bring this up / I spoke with your sister Ruth tonight She's awfully depressed and her behavior mirrors Sal's before she vanished / Although I can be there for Ruth that's not a luxury I have with Sal / If only I could see her again if only to say / I understand / Welcome to Colorado / Danny I think I hate your stories
One lemonade for the kid / One more word an' ah'll stuff mah voting age down yer scrawny bow tied neck
You look like you've done a bit of travelling Where are you from / Ah'm not willin' to talk about it / Very well then I shall talk about my own travels / Originally I'm from England right / My father's a rich bloke so I've been spending my years searching out new adventures / Though it may seem all I find in America are South Park and Friends Most unfortunate / Two words Spice Girls
 
Soo Sal is it Where are you running away from / Hmm How'd you know my name / On your backpack written in correction fluid Just out of high school yes / To be fair my name is Jason / Right now ah need to be left alone okay / For the best I guess Her tears would have watered down this terrible American beer
Sheesh what a waste of my time / Though ah prob'ly shoulda took up his offer of that lemonade Ah am rather thirsty / Naw Figger it's best to press on and oh no / YOU
Ah yes We know this human Surprising that she remembers us as well isn't it / But we'll fix that won't we Peons get the girl Your head alien commands you / Sale
Fire Don't let her escape / FZZ FZZ / Aww geez / FZZ / So Sal came crawling back on your hands and knees did you / Coke / Get her / PANT PANT PANT / BAR
Do you know these guys / Stop right there / Earth must not know of our presence yet You must be eliminated / But boss now all the other humans see us / Oh I had not forseen that / What do you suggest / Quick act like teletubbies They're probably drunk and won't know the difference / Can I order a hambur / WHAP
 
Attention people of Earth We are simply teletubbies Pay us no mind as we exterminate this young earthling / Whazzat / Wallll / Why are teletubbies after you Sal / They're not teletubbies ya moron / So get off yer rear an' help me out here / BAM / Whazzat / P.M.S.
Tell me Sal Why did you ask for my help / Beats me scrawny / Is she gone
Ah'm gettin' outta here while the gettin's good / Good idea / Why are you tagging along Those aliens aren't out to kill you / I have to I'm involved now / Okay it's because you're short and attractive / You disgust me
Are the aliens still after us / Don't think so / Let's stop I'm winded Why are these guys after you / You got me Ah dunno / Problem is ah remember them just not from where / That's swell So it's not why you ran away / Geez ain't you nosey / Quite But you're secretive so it all balances out yes
Well we lost them If you're interested we could / What's that sound / POW / I was planning on saying something evil and threatening but I think my actions speak for themselves / Thanks
 
KPOW KPOW / Up the ladder / KPOW KPOW / Right What next / Hope for a miracle / Works for me
Hurry Get on / Nevermind how we found you Jus' grab hold and we'll be clear of the head alien in no time / But who are you / You could say we're the government and we're here to help / Not what ah wanted to hear / Shut up and get on
Bah This sucks / But no matter I can search her down later It's unfortunate that our test subjects still recognize us despite the mind wipes / Computer access test subject files We're going hunting
That's it I'm marching right over to Danny's room and he'll have to like me for who I am or I split / Y'know you could just forget the dope and find your own happiness / I'm working on my feminism one liberation at a time Don't rush me / See you in five minutes
C'mon Joyce Knock on this door and give Danny your ultimatum / KNOCK KNOCK / Yeah / EEK / Stimulus response / Joe do you have any aspirin
 
So is Danny here / No he's off talking with our neighbor's sister Go away / Well fine You tell him if he doesn't accept me for who I am I'm leaving him Forever / Sounds good to me Goodbye forever / No I'm asking Danny not you / I knew there was a catch
Hey You have toys in here / Erm yeah They're transformers / You play with them That's so cute / Doesn't this clash with your Mister Macho Man image / Eh I hide them when girls come over / And what am I / You hardly count / Ohh HEY
So you don't hide your toys when I come over but you do for other girls / Act macho for you Ha / Why not What's the criteria / You're not y'know / sexy / Hey I'm plenty um that word / If you say so mother Theresa
What do you mean I'm not that word / Sexy / Yeah Why aren't I Huh / Joyce you're hardly a sex object / Hmph / Well maybe I don't want to be one How about that / But really what's all involved Do I need to wiggle my butt or something like that / Oh the humanity
Wahhh I'm not appealing No wonder Danny hates me / No he hates you for much different reasons / He hates you because you stalk him because you're psychotic because you're immature because you're completely unindependent because you don't have interestes besides getting guys to like you / Joe I get the point / Yep Yer dying old cold and alone
 
Joe Why is Joyce in here crying / WAAAHHH / Erm / Joyce what's the matter / sniff / Nothing / I'm dumb and unappealing and you're perfect and I don't deserve you / What
Hey Joe Ever notice how the elevator beeps once when going up and twice when going down / I figger I can remember that by thinking up for one beep and dow own for two Neat huh / B 1 2 3 4 5

Joyce you're pretty stupid to think I'd cry my eyes out 'cuz of a stupid movie / You mean you didn't cry at Ghost Or Shadowlands My Girl / My Girl was a sad movie / The one where bees sting the little kid and he dies / I thought that part was hilarious

Well Dan we're going to go out to dinner in a half hour or so Would you like to join us / I dunno / Of course he would / Look Hank it's as if they were already married

I told you the password couldn't possibly be bubblemonkey / Actually it's Katie Holms
Kill them / gulp / Gah / Sal / Salvador / Dadgummet if ah hear Sal one more time
 
Good to see you in proper working order Sal / Can't say th'same fer his mind control device / Puppies Where / What now head alien / You've done nothing earth girl My plan continues / Huh / The mind control device is the only means of negating its own effects My slaves still follow my orders Oops

Sal you're not really going to kill all those abductees are you / If it comes down to it / landing dock / That's crossing the line a bit don't you think / Our job is to keep the public from knowin' 'bout the aliens A few dead agents is a drop in the bucket / Priorities Jason / Sound familiar
Okay everybody into the airship / What's up with that girl / Sal Just a fun round of shutting yourself off to people Beyond that I don't have a clue / She worries me / You both worry me / Look Joyce a puppy / Ooooooo / Man's best friend
Sal / We followed you all the way here to D.C. / I see the abductees are gathered below / Think about things / Not our job
 
We're here with channel 4 news at the foot of the white house where several hundred have gathered early this new years day / Hey / You come back with that / CRUNCH / Help
Joyce you run to the white house and warn the secret service / We'll aide Sal / C'mon kid follow / my lead / This shan't be pleasant
Oh hello there Sal / Beef's too friggin' big We need him out of the way Jason Ya know nothing can hold him fer long / What are you playing at / Ah swiped yer gun / An' I swiped it back / That's my brother you
What the heck you think you're doin' I don't care if he's brainwashed he's still my brother / Our orders are to stop the aliens at any cost SEMME ain't a playschool People die / Not good people / Tony / A ack / Sorry Tony / Good people do die
Sal that was totally out of line / Ya have a better solution / We take them down now or the army takes them down for us / An' the world knows / Oh the world will know / when my minions march across the face of the earth
 
The mechs they're unmanned / Are they / Joe / Of course Abductees have an affinity with alien tech like Tony said / You could say I've got a career in human resources / Sorry sorry bad joke
Everything I've planned all boils down to this moment / With one crushing movement the citizens of Earth will know I am their new ruler / And yet three lone humans stand between me and the white house / Four / Sorry about the delay The president kept on trying to push me under his desk and completely weirded me out
Oh hurry up Just join the other three so we can shoot you all at once / Okay / No no wait that's not what I'm here for / Oh that's right I had another flash of lost memory / You don't say / Ohhh yes I do
Okay so my recovered memory goes like this / I'm in my house and I'm like 5 years old / Suddenly I'm up in the air / you guys / Oddly enough I mostly watch cartoons when you abduct me / Speaking of which cartoon villains give way too much leeway when heroes come back at the last minute and save the day / Hmmm
Anyway so I'm in an alien craft being brainwashed and all and I'm casually looking around / And it's Walkerton right beside me Walkerton is an abductee / Me / And abductees have an affinity with alien tech / Holeee
 
NO / It's you Walkerton Don't you get it It's why that first mech shut down why I must have come back for you / You little beast After all I went through to wipe your mind Pornos will be the least of your worries when I'm done with you / Kill them my slaves Now / No / It didn't work / No Mike's normally like that / I hate you all
Looks like the tables are turned head alien / Where's your army now / Where am / Joyce / I am so out of here / I can't believe this / Joyce / Joyce
Where are you taking me What about Joyce / If ah don't get ya outta here they'll make ya a SEMME agent / Why do you care / Danny needs you / Oh no he doesn't
Danny's found another girl huh / Yep / What's she like / I'd do her / Oh that narrows it down / She's bossy though / All of my women know who's boss and that I don't allow no backtalk / Y'know what ah like 'bout ya Joe Yer imagination

U.S.S. Destiny / Captain a giant mass pocket has just appeared on our instruments / Hard right I want visuals / Roger / What is that
Walky sense tingling Somewhere something's goin' on Something bad I wish I could know what / I've started to see time as a puzzle of shadows and swarms of unattributed emotions / that only become clear as they happen / I see battles / Swarms of enemy after enemy / Ending suddenly and with no other options like a speeding train out of track / And my mind expands to every corner of the universe / Agh here comes that feeling again Something big Something explosive / PFFFBBBBPPT / Well that was a relief
Humans / U.S.S.

Sarah I've changed a lot since then / Then So you admit to the murder / You don't know anything about her When she joined SEMME she had absolutely nothing She had no memories no family no friends / Everything she is today is due to her insurmountable hope and strength as a person / And soon she's going to save your petty miserable lives / Considering circumstances I find that difficult to believe

We have no responsibilities now We don't have to fight the martians We're free to live how we want / We can beat this Anti Joyce thing and then let the armed forces take care of the Martians and we can live and be happy We can hide far far away and nobody dies / This is a good thing / Okey dokey

It's Joyce isn't it You're talking about Joyce / Oh hell no Maybe a girl just like her but it'd hafta be another lifetime It's just that the girl I'm talking about is someone who I'm good friends with and I wouldn't mind if it were more / Okay so she may not end up being the best to look at / Who cares if she's ugly Have you checked out these puppies They're totally radical

Friends the Wanderer exists here As we speak this universe's Wanderer is in this universe's Belgium investigating our decoy entry point / But / This time around things will fare differently / We have an instrument of great power a font of wrath that unfortunately none of us can tap into / The beings who have the technology we need the martians remain in hiding in this universe / They also stand in our way and must ultimately be disposed of / But the martians are not unknown to all humans here There are agents sacrificial lambs / We can use them

Sal I'm with Billie You know this What are you doing / You said you loved me You said things could go back to how they used to be before / That was wrong of me I took her for granted But one night she got hurt and I remembered how much she means to my life now / Look at me Sal This is wrong Why are you doing this / Because you never judge me
So when'd you grow a spine / Hey money talks Do you have any idea how much an engagement ring costs / Lemme see / Hell no I know how this works I take it out and Billie walks 'round the corner
 
Hey I'm sorry You know I still care about you right No matter what / That's jus' the thing Nobody else does / I bet if you thought about it deeply at least one person jumps to mind / Nope

Wait Wait I'm left handed / Psyche / I'm smarter than you think / I've always been a smart boy I was smart enough to avoid thinking about things And I led a happy ignorant existence But I know too much and I can't live like that any more / And I'm too smart to fight you right now
Yer right Ah thought ah'd slap some sense into ya / Fer jus' a second forget what you know Tell me what you want Completely selfishly / What I want / There'd be no aliens No martians Nothing would separate me an' Joyce I wouldn't have to pretend We would have everything We'd have each other / We could maybe finish school Get married Settle down an' have a girl and a boy with the names we picked out Anna and Bobby They'd be smart an' happy It'd be perfect / In spite of everything we'd have each other until the end of time There would be a future An unknown future Possibilities / But the future is know Horrible things will happen to Joyce she will be alone We won't have a future We'll have months And she's wasting them with me / History isn't guaranteed to be kind Sometimes you just can't possibly change what you want into what actually happens The person who makes you happy can be happy with someone else You're not the center of life Life goes on without you / Ah know
Ah swear to you what you saw will not happen Ah'll make sure of that myself Ah promise Let's prove that we can change things / First off you said Joyce will feel alone / You can reverse that right f#' now with a damn change in attitude If you support her no crisis for her will ever be horrible / A are you two all right

I'm not a monster / I'm just a little boy / Oh hell / I'm a good little boy / I'm silly / I'm goofy / Electrochair / I like monkeys I play outside I never want to grow up

This has been fun SEMME but it's time to get down to business I've got the collateral and you've got minds I want erased / But you're ordered not to harm me / Meh Hurt mindwiped whatever I think you'll find that I give the orders around here / Well commander Walky ya better start thinkin' / Um
You're in a room full of super powered buttkickers who will remember whatever you wipe from us eventually / There's no way you're cleaning this mess up It's impossible / Walky for the love of Pete play dumb / That would be true if we stopped at mindwiping you But we can brainwash any memory into you we desire Did you think this is the first time we've had to do this / We slip in and out of here as we please and if someone happens to go missing along the way well you never knew they existed Tomorrow this will never have happened / Dina / Poop Walky Or monkeys Walkerton please
No Dina will not be forgotten I'll fight you until I die if I have to / Another fight What if another of you is caught in the crossfire / Are you risking the lives of your troops for her memory / Joyce / You're stronger than them Get out of this / Then lady how open are you to deals
I've messed up / Everything that happened here was because of me / Just leave everyone here alone Let us remember / And take me instead Do whatever you want with me I'm yours / No
W wait Walky n / It's not exactly what we came here for but I'm always for avoiding monotony / Aye You have a deal Flankman set your mindwiper to the complete setting / What the hell are you / Jason find out what they're scared of / BZZZAP
 
Dina are you all right / He left / I I thought maybe if if he would stay Maybe he would stay / But he left
Things are different now I've had the chance to live a little without you It's so much harder to just give it up after all I've learned / It's not fair I was in solitude my entire life while I tried to behave But now I'm not alone anymore I'm happy And you're taking that away from me again / I don't want to lose him
Walky no Don't hurt him / This is all my fault not his I got him drunk Please / I hope you're happy
Hey / Hey / This day / That day / It's the next full weekend we both have nights off / Are you fine with that / Yeah / Can you hold me like this right here until then / If your underwear magically cleans itself that morning perhaps
Fly to these coordinates in London and gather data for me / My assistant has grown increasingly unstable recently so you'll do this solo / Just scrape things with the spatula The whole routine is rather academic / You know I don't believe I've ever gotten a good look at your fifth member / Yeah she doesn't like sunlight / Not that we complain
 
Indeterminate advanced technology / Or perhaps / No / There is no magic Not in my domain This Mist was merely armed with the weapons of the unknown / Unknown at least to this universe / No matter His backdoor to my universe has just been sealed I can return my attentions elsewhere / Like SEMME / I'm afraid that my two recent miscalculations have humiliated me / Echoes from my past perhaps come back to haunt me / Or is it that I'm actually afraid / Thousands of years I've reigned from the very beginning and only in these familiar days do I falter / I need distance / I need objectivity / I must not fail not now / Not when it is so near
New York City / Ma'am Did you want me to move back your quarterly with the stormtroopers / No everything should continue according to schedule An' Jan / Yes ma'am / Please refrain from terming them stormtroopers / WAMM / However do thank sci re for Sal proofing the windows aye

Semme squadron 135 has shown up at our origin point I fear SEMME may be fumbling their way into our secrets This cannot happen / We will deal with squadron 135 but you have one more precaution to take / Destroy Semme's computer network There can be no surviving evidence of us If anyone sees us kill them / Understood sir / Just as soon as we deal with your so / BZAM BZAM / Shoot them before they hit the ground

I'm gonna phone in an' see if our craft is ready yet / I'll be over here / I'm doing the right thing aren't I lord / I realized Walkerton is your gift to me He loves me he completes me and he'll help me grow in places that I'm scared to touch And we're so completely devoted to each other / That's all that really matters right / I love Walky so very much and I want to do this but

Stop glarin' an' tell me what's on yer mind / Why'd you leave prison / Ah knew that was comin' but damn / 'Kay Imagine finding out that everything evil you've beaten up yourself over was just the drugged influence of some dumb conspiracy / Y'mean going crazy wasn't your fault / Yeah ah wish it were that simple All they did was enhance feelings ah already had / A drunk driver still pays for things he wouldn't have done sober / If it were up to me ah'd still be in there / That's what my principles tell me / But principles are just laws you make up to separate yourself from other people / Principles are selfish when they're more important than those people / Y'know what one of Walky's principles is Don't think too darn much / Yeah
Chief this is getting way too messy over here to kill all witnesses We're going to have to start mindwiping 'em / Walkerton give me orders I want to help / BRRZZZAP / Grace / Dina no Get back to the lab You'll just get in the way / I suppose that's the safest place from you dropping dead people on me again
Did you have something to say to me / Never mind / Y'know what Screw you Yer just jealous of my success / Well tough luck You jumped ship / I said I suppose that's the safest place from you dropping dead people on me again / You / You killed my father
Was my father's death not an accident / Oh god no / Please tell me she's wrong / I don't have to punch walls or curse at the sky anymore / I finally have someone to hold responsible / Hold that pose will you
 
Wait

What was that for / I miss your smile / So god ain't gonna be mad at me for interruptin' your chat with him / God's there forever / But on earth every moment counts / Yeah / It does
So so does this mean we're back to normal / Yes / I've had lots to think about and Dina obviously meant a lot to you But I don't think either of us want to deal with all this alone That's why we have each other / Besides I'm not any stranger to rage Of all people you know I'm not perfect / Well yeah but I changed my mind after I saw your tushie / Your flattery will keep you forgiven
You need to have a good talk with Mike / Yeah An' Tony / Tony Why / I dropped Sal's dead parents on his father / Maybe you should add Sal to your list too / I swear SEMME can't take me anywhere
 
I guess I should go take care of all that right now / It'll be fine No matter what I'll be here for you / No matter what
I don't want to do this anymore / I remember when we were at the funeral And the casket was closed There was nothing inside / There wasn't anything to say I'm sorry to / There will never be any real goodbye / And I realized it must have been that way for both of us Even if you won't ever admit to it / I'm so horrible I couldn't stand that she could choose you over me / I'm sorry / And yet they won't let me go I still have to keep on doing this / I can't do this They know I can't I was hoping for some time out But the others they don't understand / that this is the worst punishment possible I can't leave with what dignity I have left / I'm not allowed to stop / I / I brought what you asked for / I promise I'll help where I can

When the sky lit up last week I knew you'd come I've been waiting for this moment / I've spent months taking martial arts and self defense classes and here you are dropped right in my lap / Y you must be Billie / Sure You might be able to lift a car / But never underestimate a woman willing to die to keep the love of her life
BAM / Wait Hold / POW / My pants suddenly got tight and I have no idea why / Never touch me
So you're too damn kind to fight back Cruel enough to try to steal away my boyfriend but won't attack me to my #n' face Satisfy me / If ah fight back ah'll hurt you / You've already hurt me more than you could ever possibly dream convict / Don't preach to me 'bout hurt rich girl

Motherffff god damn / Whoa ah gotcha Let's get you inside Do you got Danny's number / He can get / WHAP / Ah'd say something inspirational 'bout the human spirit but you're really just pissin' me off
 
Do you need another icepack Billie / No I'm feeling much better thank you An' thanks for rushing home from work / Honey the next time a thief tries to break in just call the police okay / Danny when someone tries to take everything we have I'm gonna kick their damn ass / But look at you / You worry me sometimes I don't like seeing you hurt I'd rather things get stolen / I'll be fine / Some strength is more than physical
You're back early / Shut up / What the hell was ah frickin' doin' He's got a whole big normal life an' he don't need me in it screwin' it all up / It's no damn fair He's the only person ah love in the whole world an' he's already got everything This is the worst night ever / It couldn't have been that dreadful if you managed to get your clothes off inside out sweater girl
Who am ah kiddin' tryin' to be normal Ah try to do it fer one night an' ah end up wrasslin' like ah always do / It's all just a damn act Ah'm jus' plain foolin' myself Look at me ah'm foldin' a damn sweater / HYAH / I didn't think it physically possible to dent a wall with a sweater
Ah'm always gonna be stuck bein' alone an' diff'rent from everyone else / Don't you know how that feels / I was born tardy into a dimension hopping organization moments after stepping into this universe's earth My soul belonged to this dimension The Cheese could detect me I was worthless to my friends my father and my community / So of course I left and soon after found myself in the employ of another secret organization full of genetically enhanced supermen / So as much as it pained me to stoop to your angsty level just then absolutely I do know how that feels
Jason ahm sorry / Don't worry about it / Seeing Penny again reminded me of how much time I wasted trying to help her and how futile it all inevitably was and how I'm repeating it all over again with you / Jason yer right Am' sorry Ah really truly am Don't leave me / I'm sorry as well Sal But I'm just too tired of this to believe you
 
Jason's actin' like such a girl Ah 'xpect Joyce to pull the ol' whine an' run maybe Walky but Jason Damn / This can't be too serious Ah'll jus' wait for him to cool off an' then try to apologize again / Oh hell ah'll jus' go find him in the bar downstairs / Sir Video Game of Dubious Entertainment Value I'd either like a drink or a gun and a duck / GAME OVER / Piss off / Bar closed / Dance Dance Revolution
Thought you'd find me here / Yeah / Does it bother you / That my father is an evil overlord from another dimension / Possibly / Look ah promise not to go an' monopolize all the emotions from now on 'kay Ah know ah'm a fixer upper / Let's be friends again / As much as ah could wanna be friends with someone who scores negative on that game yer on / Purely out of retaliation
There Are we all suited up to go / Yep S'good to be stylin' my way again London here we come / Godspeed / Shouldn't we get in the car / Dammit ya ruined our moment / What / You can't get into a car dramatically / I suppose you were planning on staring down London until it journeyed to us hmm
And so I talked to this girl on the internet again I dunno man I / Her / Tiny / Godwin's Law / Joe / What / No no dude We just talk about dumb normal things I ain't in love or anythin' I swear I dunno what she even looks like / See Hey baby My favorite passtime is spelunking an' I wanna put my six inch stalactite in your guano cave / We only keep him around to weed out friends we dislike / Still got it baby / The ability to embarrass me publically
So you really talk to this online girl often / Yes but it's not all luvvy duvvy or anything Geez / Joe remember years ago when you told Danny and I that we were in denial and that we only insulted each other to camouflage our real feelings / You're doing that now / Billie I haven't insulted you once today / Not me you idiot / See There's that denial thing
 
WHUMP / Hm That was easier than I'd thought / So who else here is completely retarded
How did Doc put it / Oh right / Now that he's out of the way / All right Who saw this coming A show of hands / The human mind is kinda like a video tape The more you erase it the less stable it becomes / Single file please / Pretty soon you won't be able to erase it at all / I figger my mind's been wiped a few zillion times in my lifetime Me more than most / Looks like Doc was right
I gotta fight back I can't lose my focus / I've fought so hard to be useful fought so hard to not just be a flake I've forced myself to be so much better than Sal I can't stand her I refuse to go to pieces anymore / I slipped / But it's not fair I can't dwell on this anymore right at this very moment but / For the first time no not the first but finally I can see his sister inside him in that distant glare / I want to get away
The only advantage you had over us was surprise And now that's ours / Nonsense We still have overwhelming number superiority / BZZZAT / We have years of recon You have nothing / Really huh I wonder where Jason is
KBOOM / Find out what scares 'em huh bro / Hey Miss Blabbermouth Ah got somethin' here for ya / Jason Toss it to Joyce / Yikes / Light up the sky
 
He's yellow / He's yellow What does that mean Is it anything bad If it isn't bad then why does he look worried too / I can feel everything The mountains outside Traffic Danny's hair / When Sal used this Danny didn't turn yellow He was the only one / But Walky's yellow
BAMPF / Who tests my patience / Th the / Hey don't budge Maybe his vision is based on movement / The stench of death / Familiar / But something here is not / Senses / Intruders / He's yellow I can feel him He remembers us / No not us A feeling An appearance / A memory / I claim right of salvage
Um the boss is totally going to kill you / No / I / Jason Ya got a clear shot / Shoot the men he's captured and get yourselves the hell out of here / Lab / NO / Let them go home Their boss will deal with them / Who are you the Head Alien / So you're banking on them receiving a fate worse than death huh / Yeah Like bein' the ones left behind
Um I'll put it down now / Yeah nice an' easy / ahem / Mr. Wanderer My name is Jason / Speak / I apologize for our use of the power booster rod / These dimension hoppers have been disturbing the balance and we knew no other way of contacting you / How 'bout a Cheese Signal / You abductees surprise me Very well Jason / But do not repeat this / BAMPF / Dude you're on a first name basis with the Cheese
And so that's what happened / Yes By the time we got there Dina had already gone She'd taken the bomb upstairs to keep it away from Joe and Doc best I could tell / I'm sorry / I should really thank you for bringing this big mess to us If you hadn't done all this I Tell me why I shouldn't just turn you in / Big Boss They're the ones who brainwashed you and framed you for the martian genocide
 
So Big Boss is letting us continue to spy on my father's organization / Unofficially I'd imagine / Yes / The rest of you I think she wants to get some rest She'll decide on what to do by morning / It's just as well I haven't talked to Walky about it yet but I have a feeling our weekend is postponed / Indefinitely maybe
I need to speak with Walky / Go ahead I'm afraid of what I'd say / Are you okay / I'm perfectly perfectly fine / Oh Sal this is all my fault / Ah'm sure it's / God is punishing me / Have you not had enough fistfights yet today
Tyrannosaurus rex
I thought you might be here / H hi Jason / Whoa Jason This boy's got a lot of issues on his plate right now Better approach him with tact and candor / Tact candor and / brevity / Well good luck

 
London / Penny Is that you / Yes sir / I haven't heard from you in a while I trust your raid went as planned / Yes Of course I know the penalty for failure / Glad to hear my son didn't give you too much trouble / Any loose ends / Not anymore / BLAM
So out of squad 128 you two are the only agents available / Is that right / Yes ma'am Alan's busy fixing Joe and Tony an' Mike's stuck in the / y'know / The hospital / That reminds me Beef and squad 135 are okay They left London with no problems / Daisy says nothing happened / At all / Yeah I think something's fishy there too But back to your squad / There's going to be some changes
Walky you're still in charge / What / What / But I'm moving Mike to another squad Switching places with him will be Robin Desanto from squad 82 / Ms. Eables will you please send Robin in / You rang / NNNYEAAIEE
Robin Have any words / Fo' shizzle / buh / Like Walky when's the last time you dressed yourself Totally nineties style / Possibly eighties / Let's go fix that / W / Her abductee power is catalyzed with the consumption of lots and lots of sugar / I didn't think anyone could smell like skittles
Big Boss I I don't think Walky's maybe he's / People will talk / Sending Mike away just doesn't seem like a punishment to me / I know I understand I'm ready for that But I simply can't I've coddled him his entire life and I'm playing catch up now Thats my fault He has to he must learn to do this / There are even bigger things at stake than my reputation / Or or his state of mind / What I'm going to tell you cannot leave this room do you understand
 
When David and Sally were born I separated them With a little help I switched Sal with a boy from the next bassinet over Walters / You see you always want what you can't have the most Don't you ever tell her this but I sent Sal away so they would pay more attention to her / She was a decoy / Because the boy was the more dangerous of the two
For the longest time I tried to keep him innocent I held him back and now I'm paying for it He has to be forced into the role now I was too scared / With Robin squad 128 is now the best team possible Tony is strong but a ticking bomb Walky can handle that And I need you to make usre Walky stays okay You love each other You'll need to depend on that soon / The martians are coming back aren't they That's what this is all about isn't it / I saw inside the Cheese's noggin / The martians were an empire spanning galaxies There's more and they're angry The aliens know the Cheese knows we all know / And we're preparing
Aaaaaand this is what hip young males 're wearin' these days / Ya gotcher designer tees yer hoodies yer muscle shirts / not that I recommend that last option / Crap I'm sorry / I really don't mean to insult you it's just that I'm really freakin' nervous / It's crazy / Squad 128 is the best there is You guys get to do all the cool stuff Yer niftier than cream cheese soda in a jar / Want a candy bar / Fastbreak / Don't sweat it It's okay / Oh and ya gotta do somethin' 'bout that hair man I'm tellin' ya / If I buy this shirt will you shut up
Lights on Mike Don't kill me / Agh / My brain's all fuzzy / I know my mind was wiped yesterday but you used to not be a girl
So I get home last night from the lab and instead of Mike I find this girl Fine whatever Obviously Dina had a bigger effect on me than I'd thought and I was hallucinating So I ignored her and went to bed / It all worked out when I got up in the morning and the girl was gone So I disregarded my weird experience and went to have some breakfast As per my usual diet I started eating cocoa puffs out of the box / Now that my hallucination's got a death grip on my arm I'm wondering whether you got some 'splainin' to do or I need some serious vacation time
 
Are you having trouble with your computer / Yeah It's a little confusing / Okay select the third menu Go down Go down Now get that one Now go down Down again Now hit the one right there No there / Eh / I was never good at RPG games / This is Windows XP
Walky / Whoa whoa It's just me Tony / Look this new Robin girl is driving us all up the wall She's unpredictable vapid out of control and completely and impossibly annoying / Since you're the expert on that why don't you fix it / Now I know how Jason feels
Okay I understand Robin is driving all of you crazy / I wouldn't joe her up if she was the last girl on earth / Thanks Joe Well knowing what I know about hyperactive people I think I might be able to solve this Goofy people just want your attention They respond to seriousness with wackiness / But if someone else is providing overwhelming amounts of goofy they / I'm not joshin' you I wouldn't even joe her up the butt / Come to think of it is there anyone in this squad that we all like / The dog / # the dog
Are you sure about this Walky erton / I'm sure Don't let me out of this chair until you've sugared me up completely I gotta be 100% zany / X TREEM / sugar / It's the only way to get Robin to settle down / You could y'know ask me
I always used to think your squad was so awesome Everyone else seems to think you're horrible but I knew it couldn't be true / Now I don't know what to think / Whoops look A candy bar / Woo / Quick thinking / I'm used to dealing with short attention spans / Man I wonder what the rest of her squad must have been like / Mike on behalf of squad 82 we'd like to welcome you to our ring of magical friendship / Look Agatha he wants to shake your hand / Hugs all around
 
Dina left you Walky Why are you here / Today was so complicated / I miss the old days y'know Before Sal ran away when Dina liked me after you left therapy / So you're nostalgic for a whole two month period / It was better than the eighties / Sshhh
I want things to be normal again But they won't an' it's Sal's darn fault / She's gonna be frickin' locked away forever Why / Why'd she have to put us through / I hate her / I don't mean that
I'm sorry Joyce Everything's falling apart

In the wake of last night's event many voices are crying foul / First contact / Spearheading these concerns is Bart O'Ryan / Bart / I represent the hundreds of dead or injured from SEMME's negligence / If protecting earth from aliens is their job then my clients say they've failed / fuddam / And what of these reports that this was caused by one of SEMME's own / I seek to find out why SEMME has been twiddling its thumbs while aliens march downtown in broad daylight / This is a new era of responsibility / Yet it seems SEMME is too busy making out to do their job / 01 32A
 
Joyce / Why do we have to wear these stripes / First guys ask if I'm from SEMME then they ask if I'm that girl kissing on the news / And then they ask for favors / Do you know what it's like to be downloaded over the internet / Better ditch this tabloid
We've got a table over there / Hi Danny / Hey where's Walky / Oh he got held up / I'm jealous of her expression / I'll fix it
So how are you and Walky doing / Pretty good I think / Things are hectic at SEMME so we haven't had time to y'know settle / No time to yourselves / Not without cameras / We just need to find a closet or something / Outside worked fine for us
Walky / Hey / Wait wait / You and Joyce You kissed / She seduced me / Ew that means I've kissed Joe / And me / Hey
Oh Hey Big Boss moved me into squad 128 this morning / That's great / Sal's really going away isn't she / We don't know that yet We'll find out in a few weeks / Don't placate him She's gonna fry an' you know it / Screw Walky I'm placating me
 
I've got tip / Sweet deal / Well we're done We'll sneak off an' give you two time alone / The afternoon is ours / SNZZXX
They always talked about gettin' back to Alabama some day / John Walters / Martha Walters / There's not much to say that ah ain't said a thousand times before / 'cept thank you / You kept me alive Ah've done my best to honor that / an' keep lookin' forward
Hullo What's all this / I'm moving in / To where / Sal left an empty bed / You can't share a room with Joyce It's indecent / There's no room with Walky and Mike / So your room it is / I have a spooge free room

Alan I thought my mom fired you / Legal A Bc / Legal 99 00 / I can't blame her for not trusting me but after some talks / Oh okay / You see she didn't realize Anthony knew so / Uh huh / Walkerton talk at my human head please / Oh Right right sorry

Thanks for joining us Ms. Brown / No prob / We hope you can help clear up any confus / It's convenient that SEMME has taken so long to communicate / Live / Mr. O'Ryan alien stuff is a full time job We don't have time to handle every distraction / Why'd they pick Joyce to be on tv / Would you distrust that face / Knowing her yeah
Mr. O'Ryan certainly you value SEMME's efforts to protect / Of course / Their methods however are highly suspect / I have a list of 500 families who think their child is dead / But they're actually SEMME agents Response / M my parents know I'm alive / What do the less privileged think / They're fine with it / Pretty sure anyway / I like ponies
Walky what're you doing at the airport It's 4am / Figgered I'd pick you up / Jason an' Joe are still bein' doodie heads Couldn't sleep / Parking 2.00 / Then thanks I don't think I did too well / You were cute enough to raise SEMME's public opinion 20 points / I don't want to be cute I want ohh / Look I'm sorry / Don't be sorry Just be a shoulder
Anyone awak / gaak / gak / All right that's it Joe You get my bed I'm taking Sal's bed in Joyce's room / Any objections Good

Where do you think you'll be five years from now / I dunno I don't think about it / Five years ago I thought now I'd be out of college married to a nice guy and having babies / I figger if I don't set my expectations for anything I'll never be disappointed / Who's disappointed
This is why I think rooming together is a good idea / We can talk more / I don't know I just want us to be pure / We will be We're mature responsible adults / Says the doofus who wears my underwear on his head / That was once and that was funny
Do you remember the first time we met / Yeah / You'd just woken up in SEMME an' / No the first time / Walkyyy Walkyyy / I don't want to talk about it

Sal Walters pleaded guilty this September morning to six counts of attempted murder / She's sentenced to five years / This follows SEMME's good news last week when SEMME was granted amnesty for the alien attacks in May Lawyer Bart O'Ryan announced his thoughts / Today was a small victory for America / KPET / WUSS / Unfortunately Ms. Walters hasn't paid for the near genocide of every soul on our continent nor her disgusting treason / Several charges were dropped by close acquaintances of Walters SEMME can't protect its lunatics forever They can't bury all their crimes / Isn't that right Ms. Brown / KWIK
 
Oh hello Dina You look uh emotional / Mike says I'm worthless / He says I'm worthless because I'm insipid gutless and apathetic to my surroundings / I'm sure Mike doesn't mean th / I must be insane / smak / It's not that It's because I think he's right
It all sorta hit me when I was watching the news / And I saw myself fail from the outside as others likely see me / I think the same thing happened in the Bermuda triangle too People are dead because of me / Do you think I'm right / This is an excruciatingly unfair conversation
Try not to take what Mike says seriously / Then why do you hang around him so much / He's a great friend when he's drunk / Really / I am so leaving now
Hello Big Boss You wanted to see me / Yes commander Chesterfield We've discovered some volatile information that pertains to your squad / Oh / We've been so busy until recently and couldn't devote the manhours to this until this week but / We've narrowed it down We know which SEMME craft fired on Joyce and Sal in May
Once we pinpointed the craft and traced it back to the launching bay Alex decrypted the password used to release it / I'm sure you're well aware of the dangers of giving out passwords / Absolutely impermissible / Jason / It was your password
 
I was right with you How could I have flown th / Accomplice / You know me better than to do this / Your past / I have no past / Exactly / You're suspended until we sort this out Chesterfield / I / Don't leave town
Oh he's here now Thanks bye / I believe you / The world's more complicated than you think Walkerton
Hello Jason You okay / knok knok / Hello / He musta spontaneously combusted / Or he crawled up a hole in the closet
Why would Jason sneak out / To prove his innocence like Harrison Ford / Maybe we should try to find him before we tell your mom / Yeah This looks bad don't it / Here's Jason's sock Daniel Go get 'im Go get 'im boy / snif / Actually this looks bad / lick lick / I don't want to know the explanation for this
He's gone / Yeah / Dammit / Maybe he snuck out for tea or somethin' / I don't think so / Tony you're filling in on squad 128 / Yes ma'am / Commander Walkerton escort your troops back to your living quarters
 
Mo er ma'am you can't make me leader Tony's leader / Yeah / Walky couldn't lead me to a Hooters / Feh / He's the comic relief / You're all dismissed except for Walkerton / Seeya later momma's boy / Commander Walkerton about Tony
What took you / Sorry Let's go home Uh troops / Look is it 'cuz I don't have a bowtie Is that the problem / Whatever Gilligan
The apartment doesn't look too different / Is that a giant soda mug / You've got a photo of me framed / Yeah we put that up after you died / I guess we can erm take it down now / Is this a photo of you at a funeral / Jason said he wanted proof displayed that we can in fact dress up / What a morbid bunch
Hey commander / I can't do this without Jason / It's impossible and unfair / That's the same thing you said when Sal disappeared Walky And look you grew because of it You filled the gap Now just learn to fill Jason's gap / Like anything you just have to work at it / Alright then I command you to clean my tonsils with your tongue / Like I said you have to work at it
How much should you move in Tony What if Jason comes back / He's not coming back / Jason can't have been involved with shooting at Sal an' Joyce He's Jason / Walkerton / There's a lot you assume about Jason You don't know this squad's history / Then tell it quickly My attention span will focus on monkeys in 45 seconds / Noted
 
You were there the day we picked up Jason and Sal off the streets / Despite our suspicions Alan's report indicated you and Sal were not abductees after all / So why was the Head Alien after you We wanted to find out / What else was important was why Jason was so nosy about Sal
Jason claimed to be the estranged son of a wealthy British industrialist / Our background check found him out there are no Chesterfield industrialists Legally Jason didn't exist / Alan insisted however that he be placed in Sal's squad so we could observe him Jason joined SEMME / I was given one other task get close to Sal / Regrettably I did
Sal won me over so fast She was a ball of energy and when she smiled it was special / But underneath that was a ticking bomb of neurosis The deeper I got in the more I wanted out / What scared me was Jason's obsession with her darkness She had information buried that he wanted / That darkness ended my investigation and sealed my fate when she put a bullet through me / Whatever Jason's after it's dangerous
I'm sorry Walkerton Jason has been hiding something and all evidence points to him / I know this is hard for you to understand but / I understand thank you / Don't talk to me like I'm dumb You're dismissed to your room / This is my room / Don't talk to me like I'm dumb
I want to go back to just watching cartoons

Dancing is easy and fun and we're gonna / Nope / All you have to do is bare yourself and let the music take control / Ew that's frightening / If we're gonna be together you're gonna have to learn buster / Tough / Is Joe free tonight / Not anymore
Get jiggy / Okay okay stop I'll go dancing / Jealous / No revolted
 
Isn't this place great Walky / It sure is loud Also loud / What happened to that churchy girl that liked ponies and watching cartoons / Oh that's me / But there's so much more to life than that Sometimes you gotta cut loose / What about coasting Is there time for coasting / Aagh Boring boyfriend

What's so great about the amazing Sal anyway Am I really that inadequate / I'm sorry if being normal and not in prison isn't exciting enough for you / Why is it always like I'm talking to myself
 
The truth is I'd be dishonest if I said I don't love Sal I want her to be happy / She's been hurt so much / I'm trying to do the right thing / SLAM
I'm sorry for unloading all this on you Beef I can't talk to Walky Sal's his sister / I just don't understand / Grunt / I know / What is with her Why is she always so damn important / It's like you said / She wrested your family from you and she took mine away too / But I don't need anybody I can get by on my own / Want some vodka
Wow has it been a week already Time sure flies / Hey what's wrong / I'm just confused / Billie's getting angrier with me She doesn't want me here / She says I'm distracted / Oh / And then I said that I loved you / Oh
Why the hell did you tell her that / Well you said you loved me and I got to thinking / Danny ah told you that because ah do honestly love you / You're fantastic / Even when ah was so rotten on the inside you didn't shun me Ah was certain you would but / You overwhelm me / Ah said ah love you 'cuz ah don't know any better word for it / Appreciate
Um You should go home and patch things up now / But No / I'm not going to go choose Billie just because I can't have you / That's not right / You you dumped her for me / I didn't plan to It just / You're sweet Danny But really dumb
 
I'm not dumb Sal You said you need me but I need you too / I don't care if you're stuck in here / Ah'm in prison Danny We / Stop / Forget that Just think of when I found you and you were hurting and we held each other / I love you / Ah yeah you too
Billie / Hi / I know I've been gone for a few days and I'm sorry I anger easily and I didn't give you room to communicate / I need you and no one else It's hard for me to admit that
Hey I missed you too / I promise I'll pay more attention to you okay I love you too / I'm the biggest liar in the world and I deserve to die slowly and painfully
What's this / I'm making sandwiches for dinner tonight / Hey we're goin' out for food / No we've eaten out enough this week Walkerton / Look don't undermine my authority / I'm not I do believe however that I'm not alone on this / Oh / Hey Optimus Prime do you want McNuggets tonight / Booyah / Dude I can't disagree with Optimus / Owned

This is ridiculous This is a mockery of everything we're about / Sorry / No listen / Look at what we're doing hopping up and down naked on my bed and to avoid what Why are we going through such insane lengths not to / y'know / Because we're not ready / Why is that / Because you because I'm trying to wait for when you / No Forget me Tell me what you want
I don't want to pressure anything / Why / I pressure you all the time To sit up straight to go to dance clubs to be the good leader I know you can be / And I'm starting to feel selfish / A relationship has to be 50/50 A give and take / So again / what do you want
 
How come you keep makin' me be serious when I'm naked / Answer the question / I feel ashamed of sayin' this but I'd really like to jump your bones / All these false starts are drivin' me nutty / But your feelings matter more than that to me It's a scary step / Just 'cuz something's scary doesn't mean it's bad Walky / I think you're just gonna have to take my hand and then we'll face it / Whatever whenever you decide I trust we'll be ready
Well look who's emerged / Is dinner ready / Sure Sit down while I go pick up / This is good I think she'll be normal now / Coo' / This shirt is licked dry No wonder you picked him / Eventually
Bye mother Thanks for the meal / Nice meetin' ya / So you really think we're ready / All I said was to pick a date / Sweet What like my birthday / Mayb / Joe What's wrong / It's like millions of hormones cried out in terror and were silenced / Supply Closet
You brought your old bible with you / Yeah I guess / Heh when we get back I wouldn't let Mike see that thing / Yeah You're right
Hmph I did fine without this for four years Why did I bring it home
 
So where we goin' anyway / East coast That's where they are / They / Ah wish you'd tell me more about what we're doing Ah feel a little uneasy You're not bein' straight with me / I'll tell you when I feel like it Not right now There's some very personal issues involved / C'mon tell me Yer drivin' me crazy What kind of person keeps these things secret / Fine then If you're just bein' contrary then ah don't care / Very well / Ah hate you
Have you established my alibi Doc / Joe you're just here for technical support not to traffic illegal drugs / SEMME LABS / I just don't want the SEMME honeys around here to catch wind that I'm a science geek or something I wanna get laid again in my lifetime / Science is like some sort of virgin mafia Once you get sucked in you ain't gettin' out alive / Gee thanks a lot / Doc do you see any chicks 'round here / Chicks / The prosecution rests
SEMME's exposure to the public has lifted many strict limits on our technology We no longer have to worry that our weaponry and vehicles are quiet and easily concealed / SEMME craft / Furthermore our budget has exploded giving us room for augmentation / Like Britney's chest / Yes / We're looking for new developments in the battleship and mech classes I've assigned Dina as your partner I trust you'll keep this professional / Oh like I'm going to be seen making moves on one of Walky's girls
Current technological needs must focus on combatting powerful entitites such as the Cheese / Sounds fun / Hey Joe what are you doing around these parts / Grace We're we're uh talking about our sexual conquests / I haven't had any sexual conquests / Maybe she prefers the term sexual experiences / Scientific research if you don't mind / Oooh I just learned a new euphemism
You have a certain way with people / I do don't I / Can you teach me / You want to seduce women too / No I just want / I can almost see that actually It'd explain a lot / Listen to me / All right you get the hot tub I'll get the coeds and I'm sure one of us can scrounge up a camera from place We'll also need whipped cream peanut butter and / LET ME EXPLAIN / Make yourself noticed Thus endeth the first lesson
 
You've only been in SEMME half the time I have and look at all these friends you've made / I don't have any / Well you just gotta talk to somebody Let's go out to the lobby / So pick someone to talk to / I / Which one should I talk to / The point is for you to pick someone / Okay Which one do you think likes me Joe / You won't know they like you until you talk to them / But I can't talk to them until I know they like me / We're going to be here all day aren't we
So my plan is to wait here until someone talks to me so I know they like me / Sure it worked just great those last 20 years / Keep me posted / Hey how's it going / Hello nice weather yes hi
Wait Walky I need to fix your hair / Well maybe if you'd stop playin' with it / It's poofy / I'll do it I got a comb / You have a comb Since when / Since I figgered squad commanders should fix their own dang hair / Or maybe you're just growin' up / Hello
So are you the talk of the town yet / No I sorta gave up / Didn't get any attention huh / No / What are those safari fatigues Maybe you should try for a new look Try to play up y'know your sexy feminine wiles / How's this look / Very Minnie Mouse / Thank you / No / Don't
C'mon off with the hat / What / NO / I've never seen you without that hat on Want to attract attention / Take it off / Noooooooo / What are you balding under there / No I just really really really really like my hat / Sure and drug addicts are just in it for the nedles Gimme the hat / Over my fossilized remains
 
All right I wanna see what's under the hat / Never / Geez Dina do you have some sort of crazy abductee super glue power Let go / S s say the m magic word / Crowbar / Eeep
EEEEEEEEEEEEE / Hey whoa whoa Slow down girl What's wrong / I I'm having a real bad day / I hear ya there / The entire rest of my squad was injured in action last week Until next week I don't have a friend in the world / Reeeally
There you are / Meet my new friend Agatha She's lonely right now / Really That's too bad You know I think I can help you Do you have about an hour / I'm completely free / My name's Joe Hey let's work some of the tension out of these shoulders / Um

What do you mean we're cancelling our hanky panky night / I'm sorry / Can't you just like do this one thing and then go back to being holy or whatever / It doesn't work that way / But the whole point of being all christian is so god can forgive you for bad stuff you do / If we don't hanky panky you're putting Jesus out of a job

Well that was ugly / Joe you were eavesdropping / The toilet kept me a captive audience / Joyce it's embarrasing enough that you've absolved yourself of any sexual responsibility with that sex date thing / But I don't know if this contrived way to Jesus your way out of it is ultimately cute or laughably predictable / That's not why / It'll just hafta wait for when we're both perfectly ready / Dude Joyce That was three months ago Now no matter what or when it'll be bitter and forced / But but magic / More like old stale lucky charms
S so what do I do / No I'm not going to tell you what to freakin' do / I'm just the damn peanut gallery All I'm sayin' is to start taking responsibility over this corner of your life And me shovin' you two together ain't gonna solve that / If you gotta pray just do that whole May I be struck by lightning schtick

Okay Don't try to remember Listen as if I'm telling a story / Early 2001 you hunted down Linda Walkerton's SEMME file You wanted more and a certain third party approached you to tell it / There are four accounts of you being flown to London during several weekends First you were willing / later coerced
Chemically influenced you were molded into the perfect human soldier / Segway / I can only guess they wanted you to eliminate SEMME / They planted you outside the martian embassy to wait / and single handedly remove the Head Alien and SEMME from the picture and retrieve martian technology / Thankfully you failed / So hurry break out and we'll go / No That's bullshit
First of all ah don't believe you Second SEMME says yer tryin' to kill me / But chemically influenced # no Those were my decisions My insecurities An' this is my punishment / These walls don't hold me Ah'm here 'cuz ah should be / Besides ah'll miss all my tv shows
You can escort yourself out or ah can call for a guard okay / Let me set this straight / You're here because they can keep an eye on you Easily / They're going to pay much more attention to Walkerton now / They're going to discover that under the goofiness he's just like you / And then they'll turn him into a monster just as they did to you / And right now we're the only two who can stop them

Jason told me what really happened / What / Why did you lie to me / I'm not 'xactly proud of myself okay / Do you want to talk about it / No I think lyin' 'bout the matter firmly places it in the no talky zone

Joe Joe / What / Sorry but I needed you alone and my parents are simply smothering me / They've left me alone I'm playing fetch with their dog / Walkies / Let me guess you named him / You're a good dog Walkies
I need to talk to you / We're in trouble / My parents spoke with our pastor and want us to talk about our missionary trip at church / So make stuff up / I wiped my mind I didn't know I was even Christian until recently / If you're looking for help in that area from me you wiped more than just memories / Fine I'll ask the dog
All we have to do is find a bible so you can read it huh Mind wipe solved / Yeah I'll remember / Quick Into their room They have one in their dresser drawers / I found it / No wait This is just the Karma Sutra / GAH

I've got an idea How 'bout you tell your parents that you never went to Bulmeria / What No / What are they gonna do ground you / But I'm a good daughter / There you two lovebirds are I've made up your room for the night / On the other hand a little disobedience is part of growing up
Pardon me but I'm going to go change in the bathroom / Joyce What are you doing out here / Just 'cuz you're in your mother's house doesn't mean you have to be P.G. / Obviously my mother wants more grandkids
Look the other way okay / Right / How 'bout we both cover our eyes / Good idea / Since when did you start being so modest / hop hop hop / When you stopped looking like the little sister I never had
Joe / snxxx / Wha / Why did you used to hate me / I never hated you / You tied my hair to the back bumper of the campus bus / You have no idea how men make friends do you
Move over / I can't / Then get rid of your huge plush thing / Absolutely not / It's either that thing or you / I can't sleep without something to cuddle
 
knock knock / Good morning / Excellent news Pastor Luke called and said he'll let you two talk in lieu of his sermon this morning / I know 50 minutes is hard to fill but I'm sure you have plenty of things to talk about / Here's my plan we keep lying about everything / We're going to hell
Just follow my lead / We're so so so proud of you Joyce / AAAGH I'm sorry I'm a FRAUD
gasp / You knew the whole time / Of course / Ever since you were 8 you brought in boys claiming to be engaged / We're not stupid / You don't have to try to please us anymore Joyce / But / Or at least try harder All your letters were postmarked from Colorado / Now that I'm off the hook I officially announce that your family is #in' nuts
I'm sorry mother / Don't be / When Bobby was born I had to drop out of college Life was horrible I thought I'd messed up / I used to try to keep you from making mistakes but it seems that worked against both of us / Make your own decisions but don't hide them from us / We're smarter than you
They never stay long enough / Carol I can't find the good book / The bible's next to your briefcase dear / No no / I can't find the really good book / You should see the pages they had dog eared / AAAAAA / Kama Sutra
 
Hello / Go away / Why / You're creepy / I thought girls liked dangerous men / There's dangerous and there's drops dead people on you
Ssshhh Someone might hear you / Don't worry You told me in confidence / You got what you wanted right / Not really / What I wanted was to find the man inside the little boy / That sounds dirty / See
Dina's still not talking to you / No / She say's she'll talk to me after I start bein' mature / Well I'll show her / I'll have you know I can turn my goofiness on and off like a light / That's pretty funny / I'm serious
Walky I know you You're goofy through an' through / You got me all wrong / My immaturity is a covert disguise for a raging machine of stark adultness / Then I guess you wouldn't be adverse to doing what adults do / What / Put it to a bet / And support your habit
This money says you can't act totally mature for a week Starting now / Bring it on / Okay the time now is 3 38 pm so / PPFBBTH / That didn't count Now it counts / PPBTHOOT / Give me your money / PPPBTH / Double or nothing
 
um Hello Walky / Call me David / Where's the hidden camera
Walky did you have Jason make your bed / Walky What did you do to your hair / I cut it And my real name is David thank you / What's this / I'm ironing my socks / This might be easy now Walky but sooner or later you're gonna crack And I will find out / If you say so
Hello Dina / My shirt is pressed My shoes are tied My posture is straight
Hey where's everyone off to in a huff / For the sake of your stomach run Dina and Walkerton are at it and there's nothing that can stop them / In the lab / Ew / Well my shirt was pressed
Wow / Just wow / I'm so glad you're the real you now / From now on you can live up to your potential / From now on
 
Walkerton What's wrong with you / It's David and what / The entire building had to be evacuated because of your public display of wild horny sex / SEX We were cuddling / You put a hole through the wall Walkerton / EXTREEEM cuddling
Believe me Dina and I didn't have sex We're still virgins / That's impossible / What about her shower sounds the time with the mug or now / Never / We're not emotionally mature enough for that yet we decided / I beg to differ / That's the paradox yeah
Heh heh / So are you here to pay up / Why / Might I remind you that your bet was with me and not with Dina / Are you implying that you were raped / If willing is a kind of rape sure
Walky get up It's time for cartoons / Oh no You're not gonna trick me Only immature people watch cartoons / No no It won't count against you I don't want to watch alone / Nice try / If you don't untie me I'll cut myself free with the shattered skull of your dog's bloody carcass
Only one day left and you lose the bet / I know / I could break him / No I've had enough of your help / I really hoped it wouldn't come to this but my backup plan will not fail / I'd like 10 bean burritos 5 soft tacos and oh 13 cups of pintos / Taco Bell / TRASH
 
You're late for dinner Joyce I cooked pasta / No thanks I got my own / Taco Bell / Suit yourself / You know I'll be quite relieved when we have the real Walkerton back surprisingly / Because his replacement is even more disturbing / Shush
Where'd Joyce go / She went to the bathroom about fifteen minutes ago / Oh my god You should totally see the gross poo I took in the potty / WIIGII / HA
Pay up pay up pay up Ha Ha / But but but you I / Whatever Fine Here's your dumb money / Hee hee / Now this had better be some darn spectacular poo / Bleh I said I know you but I never said I understand you / Now wait just one second / What / What
Give Walkerton his money back Joyce / What / Now listen / He's proved to me that he is mature in the true sense of the word He treats others with respect and knows his limitations / His erm delight in bodily functions doesn't reflect on his well hidden inner sophistication in the slightest He keeps the money / No I didn't get this burning in my tushie just to lose / Mine / Oh whatever
Walky and I came to an agreement / Is that so / We decided that I keep the money / Right / And also that I'm beautiful smart and queen of the ponies / With dignity intact no doubt / PPFFT
 
What's this / It's one of those Jared's Subway Diet journals / I'm supposed to write everything I eat and its fat content Lookit how organized I am / Walkerton you've eaten nothing but Smarties for the past 24 hours / It was 2 bucks for a 3 lb bag / So this is just an elaborate method of telling us we're back to status quo / I'm reaffirming my walkyhood
Where's my prince charming / Hi smoochiekins / April Fools right Please / I am the April Fool
What happened to the new you / Tried it Got rid of it Didn't work for me / What do you mean it didn't work It was perfect / It was fun but it got boring / I can live with boring / Sssh You'll spoil our evening / Ugh too late / You know how I spell boring C H U C K Y C H E E S E S Eh
You're quiet Talk to me Have fun / C'mon this'll be by best birthday ever / or maybe my worst / All these birthdays yet you never act older
Smile / Off / I'm not a girlfriend I'm a babysitter / Betcha I can fit this whole piece in my mouth
 
David Walkerton I think I need some time away from you / What / I hardly ever see you as it is recently / Well / What other guy would stick forks in his ears for you in public / That's um sort of the point / Ain't no pleasin' you
Fine Leave me an' go back to spending all your time alone with no friends / And you can go back to pleasing no one but yourself inside your baby world
Oh Hi Mike You're why the lights are on / Hi ratface / I told him too soon I ruined his birthday / It just slipped out / It's best to tell him the truth It's harsh but you can't live a lie / Besides he'll just run back to Joyce / I need a hug
The Bermuda Triangle / The time draws nigh Soon I shall rule / Mwa ha ha ha ha / Wo That was perfect Mel / Thanks / CLAP CLAP / Do him again / I wish I was programmed to be easily amused / Four Words Mwa ha ha
Monkey Master / Oh / Maintain the balance / Eek A hippie

Serves yourself right falling for Mr. Hormones / I'll always be #2 to his stupid sex drive / Why can't he be the cuddly guy he is inside more often / Maybe I'll go show him I'm not just a silly little girl
Joyce / Joe / That was mediocre / MEDIOCRE
Joyce this isn't what we're about / Don't ruin things / Ruin things Do you think any girl in that room knows you like I do / They're empty lust / You don't know at all / I know exactly / You're scared of giving both your mind and body together
Jason / Yes / Is it all right if I talk to you / Sal's gone and I need advice / Oh of course of course / What's on your mind / It's about my sex life / Suddenly the source of Sal's mental problems becomes crystal clear
 
Jason / Mmm hmm / I usually go to Sal for things like this but / Could you listen instead / Maybe / It's about my sex life
Pack up clothes Walkerton We're finding Sal / What / You heard me Sal hasn't come back so she must be in trouble / Wait wait / I know Walkerton This is directly against orders However I have a plan to keep Big Boss / No no / Sal / in trouble / Okay yes it sounds far fetched
So here's the plan Walkerton and I will leave th / Me / Aw man / Don't be too flattered I only chose you because you know Sal best and if you're here you'll blow our secret / Hey I can keep any secret / Name one / For instance I've already tried to find Sal 5 times on my own / pat pat / I rest my case
While Walkerton and I are gone the rest of you have to cover for us / Joyce you'll be in charge / Me / I object / Yes Mike / 'Cuz now if I punch her in the face it's insubordination / Mike I order you to jump out the window
What is all this stuff / It's not just mine / Joe's coming along too / What He is not / Have you seen Joe around I wanna snuggle up and watch a movie / Yes / He is

Hi Dina / Hi / You're an ugly whore / Huh / A fat ugly whore / Okay
