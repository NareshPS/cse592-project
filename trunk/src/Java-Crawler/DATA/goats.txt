You would have thought that this year 2000 stuff would have died down once it was here. It's still all over the T.V. / You mean... Television 2000! / / It's like the news was relying on Y2K bug stories, and now that nothing's happened, they're running ridiculous filler- the first baby of "The New Millenium." / Babies 2000! / / Stop that. It's annoying as hell. / Annoyance 2000! http://www.goats.com/archive/000103.html

So if the last decade was the nineties, what's this decade called? / It's not clear. The best one I've heard is "The Naughties." / / Don't tell Toothgnip that. It's bad enough as is. What about the next one? / Dunno. The teens? But that won't make sense between 2010 and 2012. / / I suppose those would be the pre-teens. / Great. Three years of barbie nail polish and Ricky martin pin-ups. http://www.goats.com/archive/000104.html

Did you guys come here to take over the planet or something? / Initially. But it's not really worth all the effort. / / Why don't you start off small, then? Take over some koalas or something. / Tried that. Koalas are suprisingly strong. / / Strong enough to lift a city bus off of an elderly woman? / Dunno. Let's go find out. http://www.goats.com/archive/000105.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000106.html
Siobain, why are you talking to the regulars? / I'm bored, Steph. I caught myself singing the theme song to "The Nanny" the other day. / / Just remember why we lost our last jobs. Don't encourage them. / I'm not! I swear. / / Like you've never accidentally spanked a midget. / We'll have three Harper Valley IPAs. http://www.goats.com/archive/000106.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000107.html
I just never really feel safe without a ball of twine around the house. It's nature's product, you know. / / Bob. / / What? / We have to go steal a city bus. / / What was that all about? / Don't ask me, lady. I live in beer. http://www.goats.com/archive/000107.html

All right weaselnuts. Off the bus. This vehicle is now the property of the Alien Liberation Front. / A.L.F.? / / $1.50 if you want to ride. / It's a viable acronym. / It's been used before. Totally unoriginal. / / $1.50, or off the bus. C'mon. / Settle down, Beavis. We'll be with you in a moment. / See? See? You did it again! http://www.goats.com/archive/000110.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000111.html
Like you've ever had an original thought. / Excuse me, but I certainly have. I am a writer. / / A portfolio of erotic "Buffy" fan fiction does not a writer make. / Hey, I'm not the one who was locked in the bathroom for an hour with a copy of "Buffy's Big Adventure". / / One dollar, fifty cents. C'mon. / Does it look like I have pockets? / And you never did buy new Kleenex. http://www.goats.com/archive/000111.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000112.html
You know, we didn't have to pay the bus fare. We could have blasted the driver. / Not what I would call an original solution. / / Fine. We could have slapped him senseless with our magic herrings. / We have magic herrings? / / I do. Did you lose your herring? / I guess. I suppose I'll have to turn on the closed captions. http://www.goats.com/archive/000112.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000113.html
All right everyone! If this bus drops below 50 miles per hour, I'm gonna blow it up!! / / Braaap!! / / Now that was unoriginal. / Although the notion that a New York city bus could move that quickly is highly original. / Crispy fries. http://www.goats.com/archive/000113.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000114.html
I can't believe they kicked us off the bus. / I managed to rifle through the gunman's pockets before they carted him away. / / It was still structurally sound. Those seats were extraneous anyway. / I snagged a pair of Manilow tickets and a cell phone. / / You can keep the tickets if I can have the phone. / Hell no. It has a 'vibrate' setting. I'm in love. http://www.goats.com/archive/000114.html

What's he doing? / Conducting market research. / Excuse me, sir, but I'd like to ask you a few questions. / / Yes, I understand that people are eating dinner now, but that doesn't excuse that sort of language. Hello? Hello... / / So the research is going well? / I have concluded that eating dinner causes anger. / Dinner must be stopped. http://www.goats.com/archive/000118.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000119.html
And where are you guys getting these numbers you're calling? / Neil's just dialing random digits. / I'm sorry, little girl, but if your mommy doesn't come to the phone, she's going to hell. The Pope said so. / / His phone technique is enviable. What are you guys researching again? / Dunno. We'll worry about that if anyone actually talks to us. / THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU TO ANSWER THIS SHORT SURVEY!! http://www.goats.com/archive/000119.html

Quiet. It's ringing. / Can we just stop for a bit to order some food? / / Oh my. I seem to have dialed a leather and bondage supply shop. / Food can wait. Gimme. / / Go steal some credit cards.

Bob, there's a package here for you... from Clench 'N' Thrust Bondage Supply! / / For me? Neil, you shouldn't have... / Well, I felt bad about missing your birthday and all. / / It's a sex dwarf!

...so she left me a message asking if I wanted to go to dinner. / Wow. You gonna go? / / Nah. I mean... she's a zombie now. / Since when can you afford to have standards? / / Something's humping my arm. / Oh, so zombies are beneath you, but sex dwarves are okay? http://www.goats.com/archive/000124.html

Excuse me, but I think this is yours. / Uh Uh Uh / So that's where you've been off to! Naughty, naughty sex dwarf. / / I would like you on a black leash... I would parade you down the high streets! You've got the attraction, you've got the pulling power... Walk my little doggie! Walk my little SEX DWARF!! / / This is just so wrong. / You're telling me. What about my needs? http://www.goats.com/archive/000125.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000126.html
Bob is absolutely out of control with this sex dwarf thing. / Jealous much? / / Like you would be able to sleep through all that incessant pounding... slipping on empty tubes of lubricant scattered about the floor, hamster droppings clogging the ship's fuel intake. That's not love... that's... that's... / Tainted love? / / Inconsiderate. / At least he doesn't leave the toilet seat up like some people. / Quiet. http://www.goats.com/archive/000126.html

Man. you'd think they'd stop at some point. / clank clank thump / / All right, you GWAR reject, what the hell are you doing to those engines? / / Ow. / Thwack http://www.goats.com/archive/000127.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000128.html
Neil! What happened to you!? / Uhhhh.... / / Didn't I tell you to lay off the crack? / No, Lynda... Sex dwarf hammered my head with a baseball bat. He must have dumped me here while I was unconscious. / / Oh, wow... are you okay? / Yeah. The koala softened the blow. http://www.goats.com/archive/000128.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/000131.html
Neato spaceship. Who does your decor? / Bob! are you okay? / Oh... Hey guys! / / Where's the sex dwarf? Did he tie you up? / Um... yeah. We were playing "Janet Reno and Madeline Albright". / / Well, while you were in here getting your rocks off, he's stolen most of our engine technology. / That's not part of the game? http://www.goats.com/archive/000131.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000201.html
So Sex Dwarf just ran off with all your technology? Wow. Who knew a dwarf could be so evil. / Just goes to show that you can never trust short people. / I think we've all learned a valuable lesson today. / / So what's he doing with the spaceship parts? / Dunno. Bob, can we lock onto the engine's tracking signal? / Yeah. I think I have a location. / / uh uh uh http://www.goats.com/archive/000201.html

I guess this is last call, then. http://www.goats.com/archive/000202.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000203.html
So Sex Dwarf is terrorizing the city in a giant robotic suit constructed from your alien technology? / Thank you for the excellent recap. / / No problem. We can just blast him from orbit. / Think again, hazelnuts. He dismantled our engines, remember? Let's get down to the pub - I have an idea. / / Wait a second... why are you giving the orders?

sex dwarf / gnawing / jerrell / robot / All right... we're going to stage a two-pronged attack on the Sex Dwarf. First, Jerrell will gnaw on the robot's leather exterior, weakening it. / / Jon and Phillip, you guys are wave two. You'll go get on your Geek Patrol outfits and finish off the beast, like Rosie O'Donnell finishing off a six-foot hoagie. / / Good luck, gentlemen. / I'll do it.

Well, despite your incredible ineffectiveness and your general loser status, you guys weren't the weak link in our plan to defeat Sex Dwarf. / Die Die / Cool. / We rock. / / Seems that Jerrell was unable to gnaw through the robot's chewy leather exterior before it tried to hump him into small fleshy bits. Jerrell is simply too attractive... only one person is repellent enough to fend off Sex Dwarf's villainous advances. / / Now? Right now? But "Chess Review Weekly" is on... aw. Fine.

NY 1 / 5:25 / It seems that the giant robot that has been terrorizing New York has stopped it's rampage, as a strange fat boy in a cape has approached the beast, holding only a chessboard. He seems to be setting up the board, as if to play against the robot! Will a simple game of chess help end the horror? Let's go there now. / / Ooh. / Ooh. / Ooh. / Ooh. / Crunch. / / That's gotta hurt. / Who didn't see that coming? / Is crushing your opponent a legal move? http://www.goats.com/archive/000210.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000211.html
Well, all our efforts to stop Sex Dwarf have failed, and Chessmaster 2000 is in traction for the next six months. I'm all out of ideas. / We could give up. / / You mean, just let Sex Dwarf win? Keep our engine parts? Destroy the city? / Umm... yeah. / / Man, I love it when a plan comes together. / Dealing with problems is only for people too weak to run away from them. http://www.goats.com/archive/000211.html

Bobo, since you're the returning champion, you get to pick the first category. / / I choose "Llamas Last Longer" for $100, Alex. / / Llamas are renowned for their talents in this sensual act. / / My nipples are getting hard, Alex. / / That's not the answer we were looking for. / / No, really.

Quick... turn on the T.V. / / ... mourning the early passing of T.V. game show host Alex Trebek, as he was bludgeoned to death with a stack of his own Jeopardy! question index cards. The two assailants are still at large, but eyewitness reports describe them as "short + angry." / / This is so cool. / Gah. / Friends of Trebek expressed surprise that "the narcissistic bastard lasted this long." http://www.goats.com/archive/990804.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990805.html
This is so incredible... Neil and Bob, on the run from the law... it's so romantic. / Romantic? They're murderers! / / It's only murder if you're the same species. / It's wrong, Diablo. It's wrong to kill game show hosts. / / McNuggets, anyone? / Ooh. / Break out the honey mustard, baby. http://www.goats.com/archive/990805.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990806.html
Keith Shellac, Reporter / By now, you've no doubt heard of the gruesome murder of game show host Alex Trebek by two New Yorkers who have been identified by police as Neil and Bob Menendez. Officials are still puzzled as to why such a tragedy has occurred. / / In an effort ot get a better understanding of this mystery, we have with us Arthur Lemming, a man on the street with no expert credentials whatsoever. Arthur, why do you think this horrible, horrible massacre happened? / / 'TWAS THE MEDIA! 'TWAS THE FAULT OF THE MEDIA! / Stay tuned as we fan the flames with a vivid re-enactment of the murder. http://www.goats.com/archive/990806.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990809.html
You're actually going to an Alex Trebek candlelight vigil. / I... I feel like I knew him. Like he was a part of my life. / / Instead of going to Beerfest '99? With me? / You wouldn't understand. It requires emotions. / / Emotions? He was a self-important, egotistical bastard who you only had one-way interactions with. / Which probably goes a long way towards explaining why I'm dating you. http://www.goats.com/archive/990809.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990810.html
I swear, people in this country have an unnatural obsession with their celebrities. Did Trebek actually do anything to improve your life? No. He was simply famous for being famous. / / He hosted a game show, which is more than I can say for you. / He only got that show because of the fame of his father, you know. / / Who was his father? / Give me a break. I'm just trying to make the parallel work. http://www.goats.com/archive/990810.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990811.html
NY 1 / Keith Shellac / We have with us today Neil and Bob Menendez, the duo responsible for the Trebek murder, live from an undisclosed location. Thank you for this exclusive, gentlemen. / / The question the entire country is asking: why kill Trebek with a stack of Jeopardy! question index cards? / Because I didn't have my blaster. / / How have you managed to evade the police so far? / Damned if I know. / / They're not in here. Can you check the fridge again? http://www.goats.com/archive/990811.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990812.html
Polls show that Neil and Bob are too telegenic. Viewers feel they're not responsible. / But it's pretty clear that they killed Trebek. / / Doesn't matter. We need a new angle on the story; someone to blame. / Experts say, "It's the media's fault." / / Too broad. That could include us. / "Video games corrupt alien youth." / How 'bout "Daytrading made me a killer," says alien. http://www.goats.com/archive/990812.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990813.html
Experts now say that the responsibility for the brutal slaying of game show host Alex Trebek lay not in the hands of Neil and Bob, Trebek's killers, or their parents. / / Instead, experts now say that blame can be laid at the door of the index card industry, video game companies, pornographers, cartoonists, ice cream makers, and anything else people may find enjoyable. / / That sounds logical. / / Yes. I will accept that as truth. http://www.goats.com/archive/990813.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990816.html
Is this what I think it is? / Yup. A Commodore PET. Picked it up at a flea market for five dollars. / / A steal at twice that. Whatcha gonna do with it? / I'm writing a web browser for it. / / Why does your name keep scrolling across the screen? / It's hard to write a browser when you only have 32k of RAM to work with. http://www.goats.com/archive/990816.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990817.html
How's the browser coming? / To hell with that. I found an old copy of "Lemonade." It's loading off the cassette drive as we speak. / / / Did you hear? They have beer at the pub now. / Don't make me choose between my babies, you heartless bastard. http://www.goats.com/archive/990817.html

Have you guys tried this yet? Jerrell's entering his "Die Die Die.P.A." in this year's 'Extreme Brewing' contest. It's not half bad, actually. / / Very interesting flavor. It's tart, but bitter at the same time. / Kinda like Lori. / / I don't get it. Could you explain that? Loudly? / What, that Lori's a bitter tart? http://www.goats.com/archive/990818.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990819.html
There's no way you can beat Jerrell. Not with the amount of time left. / Maybe we could travel back in time six months, brew our beer, and then enter the contest. / / Maybe you could win the "Extreme Brewing" contest with your hackneyed, cliched contrivances. But if you want a devious, evil scheme, one guaranteed to work, I'm your man. / / How? / Ask me again on the 30th. / The dramatic tension is killing me. http://www.goats.com/archive/990819.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990831.html
To fully explain to you what I have in mind to win the brewing contest, we'll need to go back to a dark time in my youth, shortly after the media spectacle following my expulsion from Harvard business school, which I'm sure you've all heard about. / / After a failed stint as a prostitute in Amsterdam's red light district, I was working my way through Europe, picking grapes in Epernay, France. My mentor in the fields was a wizened, one-eyed quadruple amputee named Shazam Twix. Twix taught me many things, such as how to hypnotize a squirrel with a pair of Ben-wa balls. / / What a load of crap. You've never been to business school. / But you bought the bit about Amsterdam, right? / Ben-wa balls? Really? http://www.goats.com/archive/990831.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990901.html
In addition to the tricks with the squirrels, Shazam Twix also introduced me to a lot of other things out in the vineyards of Epernay. The days were long, and we killed a lot of hours with long games of bocce under the influence of "alternative" drugs. Twix was an exceptional player aided by the strength of his robotic limbs. / / One day, after a particularly grueling bocce match played whilst strung out on free-based lemon merangue, we stumbled into town to flirt with the champagne cellar tour guides, who were renowned for their lax morals and talented fingers. Strangely, many of them had unnatural attachments to their pet ferrets... / / ...or as they would call them, "ferrets". But I digress. / Couldn't tell. http://www.goats.com/archive/990901.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990902.html
Usually, Twix would scare off the tour guides with his drug-induced ideological rants, shouting about how the purity of bocce was being undermined by the Socialist state, and how only Government-sanctioned, institutionalized worship of the sport would ever restore it to its previous holy status. / / On the other hand, I was as smooth with the ladies as a newly-shorn sheep covered in baby oil. They would often take me on private tours of the cellars, pointing out hidden passageways where they would often take long, luxurious, lascivious lunches with their pet ferrets. / / One night, long after the riddlers had gone home and Twix had passed out after a particularly frenzied merengue high, the most morally challenged of the guides, Saffron, invited me down into the cellar to explore the hidden tunnels with her. Little did I know what awaited me... / One night, long after the riddlers had gone home and Twix had passed out after a particularly frenzied meringue high, the most morally challenged of the guides, Saffron, invited me down into the cellar to explore the hidden tunnels with her. Little did I know what awaited me... http://www.goats.com/archive/990902.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990903.html
Saffron led me down the dank corridors until we came upon a cavernous room, filled with tens of thousands of luscious tour guides from all over the champagne region. They were seated in what appeared to be a magnificent underground stadium, engrossed by the action taking place in a small ring at the center of the arena. / / As I approached the ring, I saw to my surprise a steel cage death match pitting Gregor Samsa, Giant Insect, against Gregor Mendel, Father of Modern Genetics! The fight was reffed by Martha Raye, denture wearer. / / I'm supposed to be high for this story, right? / It might help. / I have some paste. http://www.goats.com/archive/990903.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990906.html
Saffron and I took our seats in the stands, careful not to miss any of the action in the ring below. I flagged down one of the wandering concession men and bought her some milk duds. "I have something to tell you," she whispered, running her hand across my thigh. / / Just then, Mendel dealt Samsa a devastating Punnett Square Power Punch! The cowardly insect scurried off to find refuge under a nearby giant refrigerator. / / I turned back to Saffron to finish our conversation, but she had passed out from the excitement and a milk dud overdoes. The caramel-and-chocolate goodness had been too much for her to bear. I went off in search of Mendel, determined to get his autograph. http://www.goats.com/archive/990906.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990907.html
I pushed my way past the crowd of paparazzi gathered outside of Mendel's dressing room, slipping the guard $50 to gain entrance to the inner sanctum. Mendel sat inside, relaxing in a smoking jacket with a bowl of split-pea soup at his side. / / He invited me to sit down, offering me a bowl of my own. We chatted for hours, discussing the distribution of recessive yellow flower alleles and his new-found success as a wrestler over a hundred years after his death. / / / Mendel's Laboratory Keys. / We parted as friends, with plans to meet the next day for dim sum. Little did he know that I had other plans... plans involving the key I had lifted from the pocket of his smoking jacket. http://www.goats.com/archive/990907.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990908.html
I bade my time, hiding out in the champagne cellar tunnels until the spectators, and Mendel, had gone home for the evening. When the time was right, I crept back into Mendel's dressing room and found the door to his secret laboratory. / / The darkened lab stood before me, bunsen burners and erlenmeyer flasks bathed in the shadows of scientific discovery. Two hundred years of genetic research and innovation would soon be mine. I popped a "mentos". / / But before I could go any further, I felt a sharp pain at the base of my neck as a giant mutant pea plant brought down the cold steel of a monkey wrench on my head. The world swam and went black. http://www.goats.com/archive/990908.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990909.html
I awoke to find myself chained to a wall of Mendel's laboratory. Mendel himself stood before me, accompanied by a small army of his vicious, hyperintelligent pea plants. / / "Diablo," he chuckled, "I was worried for you when you didn't show for dim sum today. A shame, really. I had so looked forward to eating pork buns and sticky balls with you." / / Pork buns. / Yeah. It's hard to sound menacing when you're talking about dim sum. / "I will destroy you with my deadly shrimp balls." http://www.goats.com/archive/990909.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990910.html
Mendel giggled maniacally, stroking his hands as if they were naughty, naughty hamsters that had stayed out past their curfew. "I'm so sorry, Mr. Diablo, but you'll understand that I can't let you leave here alive, knowing what you do." / / As his pea-plant henchmen closed in on me, xylem and phloem pulsing with the knowledge that they would be having kung pao chicken for dinner, I prayed for a contrived plot twist to free me from my predicament. / / Just as their greasy tentacles were about to close my eyes forever, Shazam Twix burst through the wall beside me with his powerful robotic arms! High as a kite, his nostrils encrusted with the residue of a dozen pixie stix, he began to shout irrationally. "Deus ex machina!!" http://www.goats.com/archive/990910.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990913.html
Shazam Twix began frantically lobbing bocce balls around the lab, whacking the monstrous pea plants in what would have been their heads if pea plants had heads. His powerful robotic arms worked furiously, disabling the attackers as they approached. / / Twix activated a timed explosive bocce ball and rolled it into the heart of Mendel's lair. We ran for the exit, shouting rude and demeaning epithets in a variety of dead languages, evading the few remaining plants as they grabbed at us. I popped another "Mentos." / / We leapt free of the lab just as the tremendous fireball engulfed it. Miraculously unharmed, Twix turned to me and said, "Marry me, baby." "You bet," I replied. We embraced as the credits rolled. http://www.goats.com/archive/990913.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990914.html
We were married a week later. Today, Twix and I live in a cottage in New Jersey with our kids. / That was beautiful. / / You live in Manhattan with Phillip and me. / Beauty truth, truth beauty. / You always have to ruin it for us, don't you, Jon? / / Fine. You're married to a frenchman. / And we have five kids. / What are their names? http://www.goats.com/archive/990914.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990915.html
So, please, tell me how your little story is supposed to help us win the brewing contest. / I'm pretty sure that was in there somewhere. / / No, actually, it wasn't. / Are you sure? I could go over it again. / / No, No, that's really not necessary. / I don't mind. / WHAT ABOUT THE GODDAMN BEER?!? http://www.goats.com/archive/990915.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990916.html
So that story has absolutely nothing to do with how we're supposed to win the "Extreme Brewing" contest. / Nah. Not really. / / No magical brewing technique you learned in france? No packet of genetically enhanced "Mendels Yeast" found amongst the cellar tunnels? / Nope. / / Do you have anything to say for yourself? / Phillip still has a case of the "Goat Scrotum Ale" he brewed last fall. / Oh yeah. http://www.goats.com/archive/990916.html

That girl keep staring at me. / So we'll catch the next show. What's the big deal? / If you have to ask, then you won't understand. / / She looks angry. / It's important to try to look at the positive aspects of this experience. / The glass is empty, Diablo. / / How's my hair? / For instance, this is an ideal time to practice fighting terrorists on the top of the train. / Okay. But I get to be Jon Voight. http://www.goats.com/archive/990616.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990617.html
I can't believe we're going to miss the movie. / Just... just shut up. You're unbelievable. Did you know that the only girl who ever told me that she loved me got married last weekend? She said she'd be with me always. Now, I don't even know her last name. I haven't said a thing. You, on the other hand, have a loving girlfriend and a multi-million dollar internet company, but can't stop complaining about some stupid movie. Gah. / / What's up his ass? / Damned if I know. http://www.goats.com/archive/990617.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990618.html
So? How was Hitler vs. Godzilla? / Dunno. We never got to see it. The subway broke down, and then Jon ran off in a huff. / / Why? / Something about forgetting someone's name. He's not too bright, you know. / His ex got married. / / Celia got married? And you let him run off? He didn't have anything sharp, did he? / Just some pretzels. Those little bits of salt can be sharp. / Just like Phillip. http://www.goats.com/archive/990618.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990621.html
How could you let jon run off like that? He's your friend. / That's never been established. / / Sometimes I can't believe him... Lynda, he was upset that I was complaining. As though his problems are so horrific that no one else's could possibly compare. It's almost... competitive. Like he owns the patent on whining. / / Patent pending. He hasn't filed the forms yet. / What's "kvetching"? http://www.goats.com/archive/990621.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990622.html
I mean, what do you want me to do? Coddle him? Stroke his ego a bit? / No, that's no what I'm saying. / / Maybe I should buy him little gifts. A present to soothe his troubled soul, perhaps. / Or you could listen to him. / / Here, Jon! I bought you an albatross to wear around your neck! Now the whole world can see the weight that you bear. / Sure. Perfect. http://www.goats.com/archive/990622.html

You know, Jerrell, I find it refreshing that I can talk to you without the pretense of being interested in you. / Die Die Fornicate 666 Die. / / You understand what's important: me. You don't muddle the conversation with annoying "problems" or "issues." It's like we have a connection... a... a... what do you call it? / / Die Die Die Die Die. Die Die. / Exactly. http://www.goats.com/archive/990623.html

Okay. I grant you that objective reality is known only insofar as it conforms to the essential structure of the knowing mind. But the man still had terrible hygiene. / Die Die Die / / Oh yeah? Well, if you like Kant so much, why don't you marry him? Things lying beyond experience, noumena, are unknowable, even though in some cases we assume a priori knowledge of them? A priori, my ass!! / / I take it things didn't work out. / No... I don't blame him, though. We're just at different places. http://www.goats.com/archive/990625.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990628.html
Phillip, I... I'm really sorry for yelling at you earlier. It was uncalled for. I sold my I.P.A. so I could buy you this hefeweizen. / / Well, even though I feel that I did nothing wrong, and further complicated by the fact that I have plenty of available cash, I sold my hefeweizen to buy you this I.P.A. / / Well, this was completely pointless. / Yeah. Let's go get loaded. http://www.goats.com/archive/990628.html

Only you could something so heinous... polluting this pristine den of iniquity with your karaoke machine. / / Not this time.

Best song ever. http://www.goats.com/archive/990630.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990701.html
A karaoke machine, Diablo? This time you've gone too far. / It's all part of my scheme to get us free beer. / / Really? / / Nah. I'm just joshin' ya. It's just for your usual G.S.S.M. / / Generic Satanic Subliminal Messages? / / Ooh. Even better. http://www.goats.com/archive/990701.html

Seriously, Diablo. What does G.S.S.M. really stand for? / I'm not saying. / / Good Son, Sexy Mommy? Go South, Suck Meat? Garry Shandling Salivates Merrily? / Not even close. / / Please. I need to know. Tell me. / Only if you can guess what this is. http://www.goats.com/archive/990702.html

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us tonight. My name is Bob, and I'll be your lyrical gangsta for the evening. With me, as always, is Neil and his "ice ice" baby grand. / Hi. / / Our first number tonight is a little ditty I'm sure you're all familiar with; a song about a boy, his dog, some lubricant, and the pain of growing up. / Forcefully. / / But for me, this song... this song is so much more. It's about reaching for the stars. About never giving up. It's a song... about cheese. / Head cheese. http://www.goats.com/archive/990706.html

Neil and I were doing a show in a bar outside of Darmstadt not too long ago. One evening, into the bar walk two lizards, the Pope, a rabbi, thirteen beefsteak tomatoes... / / Later / / ...and as I turn away from the prostitute, the lemur says to me, he says, "but the fish goes first!" / LOL! / / True story, folks. True story. / I love that one. http://www.goats.com/archive/990707.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990708.html
I don't get it. Why did the bald man say "but the fish goes first" at the end of his story? / / It's a joke. You see, he had been talking to the prostitute, but the fish... you see? the fish goes first. / Did the fish get gravel from the pretty lady? / / Yes. The fish got gravel. / Ooh! I like that story. Does he know any other gravel stories? http://www.goats.com/archive/990708.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990709.html
I bet I can come up with a better joke than that one. / / / Don't strain yourself. / Don't patronize me. I may be a fish, but I'm not a... um... some other fish. Or a gazelle. Or a marmoset. http://www.goats.com/archive/990709.html

You heard that Neil and Bob are going to be on Jeopardy? / Yeah. It's so exciting. Like that time I went on that date with Lisa Loeb. / / It's nothing like... wait.

Hi. I'm Alex Trebek, and welcome to Jeopardy. Let's start off day two of our "Morally Ambiguous" week by meeting our contestants.

And our final contestants today are Neil and Bob Menendez, who hail from New York. / Hi, Alex. / Hi, Alex. / / It says here on your form that... um... wait. I can't read this. / That first bit says "anal probes," Alex.

Your talk about stock options yesterday got me thinking... so I've taken Moistnap.com public. / We had an IPO? / / Yup. Shares rocketed up from an initial price of $3.50, opening at $160.00. They finished the day at $93 a piece. We each netted $50 million, and made a lot of day traders very, very poor. / / Woohoo! We can get central hefeweizen for the apartment! / Shine on, you crazy diamond. http://www.goats.com/archive/990428.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990429.html
NY 1 / Keith Shellac, Reporter / We're here today with Phillip and Diablo, wunderkind founders of the wildly successful Moistnap.com moistened towelette community website, which successfully stunned Wall Street by pulling off the most successful IPO ever for a moistened products company. / / Hello, gentlemen. We've all heard stories of how you started out, serving web pages off of pocket calculators from your college dorm room, fighting off larger competitors like Towelsoft with silverware stolen from the dining halls. And now, 4 years later, an IPO. / / To what do you attribute your success? / I think it's due to the fact that we're not only "young," but "hip" as well. / And evil. Very, very evil. http://www.goats.com/archive/990429.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990430.html
So we're stinking rich now, right? / Not exactly. Your money is locked up in stock, and there's a six-month moratorium on stock sales by company principles. / / But we can sell our shares after that, right? / Nope. You guys know too much about the workings of the company. Only your most clueless employees can sell without being accused of insider trading. / / Jerrell's FORNICATORIUM / Grand Opening http://www.goats.com/archive/990430.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990503.html
You know, Jon, you haven't had an existential crisis in well over a month. What's wrong? / Nothing's wrong. / / It's just that I've given up. Given up trying to find someone who understands me, given up tempting fate to do nasty, cruel things to me, given up trying to fight the system and make something of my life. I'm just going to sit here, not rock the boat, and wait to die. / / Welcome to our world of toys. Care for a beer? / Oh God yes. http://www.goats.com/archive/990503.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990504.html
Phillip says you've finally given up on life. / I have. And don't try to talk me out of it. / / On the contrary. It's about time. / I'm tired of getting beat up by life. I'm just going to stick to what I do best. / / Bitch and moan? / Well, yeah. That, and skee-ball. http://www.goats.com/archive/990504.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990505.html
Clearly, the universe has something against me. A master plan to keep me in a constant state of dashed hopes and despair. I can't bear the loneliness for much longer. How do you deal with it, Phillip? / / I don't. I have a girlfriend. / What, you went out and bought yourself an inflatable playmate? / / Actually, we've been together for over a year. You're just too self-absorbed to notice. / Does she have friends? http://www.goats.com/archive/990505.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990506.html
I can't believe Phillip has a girlfriend. What sort of warped mind could find him attractive? / My friend Lauren. / / You knew about this? / Yes. I set them up. / / And she actually dates him? Is she a lobotomite? Can you get any more of them? I'm not picky. / Really. http://www.goats.com/archive/990506.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990507.html
You couldn't possibly have a girlfriend. You made it up. / Ssh. She's on the phone right now. / / / Give it. / She doesn't want to talk to you. She says you reek of Adam Curry's nether regions. / / Liar! Hand it over, troglodyte! / How do you eat with such stumpy arms? http://www.goats.com/archive/990507.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990510.html
I think it's pretty clear that you've invented this woman solely to irritate me. / Prove it. / / You can't expect me to give you a mathematical proof that your imaginary friend is actually imaginary. / If you can't prove that she doesn't exist, simple deduction shows that she does exist. / / I swear, if Plato was here right now, he'd kick your ass. / Prove it. http://www.goats.com/archive/990510.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990511.html
Jon, meet my girlfriend, Lauren. / / / That's it? Does she do anything else? / Dunno. Maybe she transforms into a robot. / Maybe she withholds sex this month. http://www.goats.com/archive/990511.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990512.html
You two make an... um... interesting couple. How did you meet? / Well, it's a really romantic story, actually. / / I was standing over at the other end of the bar, talking to Lynda, when Phillip came over and asked if he could buy me a drink. I said okay, and he pulled a pint glass of some colorless, odorless, tasteless liquid out of his pants. / / That's, um... that's his way of saying he likes you. / Strange... I... I don't remember anything after that. http://www.goats.com/archive/990512.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990513.html
You must be Diablo. I'm Lauren. You are such a cute little chicken, aren't you? / I am not cute. I'm evil. / / Maybe the cute little chicken can give us a kiss? / Evil chickens don't kiss. / / Oh, c'mon. One little kiss. / Phillip's really not doing it for you, huh? / Goat sense... tingling... detecting sexual dissatisfaction... http://www.goats.com/archive/990513.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990514.html
Lauren, we realize that being introduced to all of Phillip's friends might be a bit... traumatic for you. So we'd like to welcome you to our little family with a small ceremony we reserve for special occasions. / / First, you must put on the blindfold of trust. / This is adorable. You guys are so nice to include me like this. / / Now, put on the studded leather manacles of trust. / Hold on. / I'll go get the massage oil of trust. http://www.goats.com/archive/990514.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990517.html
Toothgnip and Diablo have your girlfriend tied up and oiled down. / I must drink beer. / Beer is the mind-killer. Beer is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my beer. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see it's path. / When the beer has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. / I'll be hiding in the corner. http://www.goats.com/archive/990517.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990518.html
Jon says you've captured my girlfriend. / Just a little. She's lots of fun to play with. / / Look... if it was up to me, you could tie her up any which way but loose. It builds character. But if you make her angry, she's not going to let me come down to the bar to hang out with you guys anymore. / / So... you're saying it's a potential Yoko situation. / And Ringo's not going to be around to bail us out this time. http://www.goats.com/archive/990518.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990519.html
Go away. Haven't you done enough damage? / I'm sorry, Lauren. I was bad. / / *kiss* / / Well, um... uh... I guess it's okay... / (I get her organs when you're done with her.) / (Sure.) http://www.goats.com/archive/990519.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990520.html
Well, we've successfully resolved another storyline. Phillip gets to keep his girlfriend, Toothgnip gets to sleep with those Japanese stewardesses, and I stole the kidneys out of several sleeping lawyers. / / What do you mean, resolved? Nothing's been resolved. I'm still depressed and lonely and without any hope for the future. / / Oh! And Fish won a lacy brassiere and a halter top in a strip poker game. / Stop it. / And I just made it with Kobe Tai in the stockroom. http://www.goats.com/archive/990520.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990521.html
I have been waiting online for fifteen months. In the name of all that is holy and/or chess-related, give me my Phantom Menace tickets. / / This is the line for "Sparky's Big Enema Adventure."

Something's not right here. I sense a great disturbance in this theatre... as if millions of people were being forced to watch "Suddenly Susan." / / Meanwhile... / Darth Shields...

Union Square is sparsely populated... if the trace was correct, Master, I should be able to find them quickly and without hindrance. / / You have been well trained, my young apprentice.

Now, I am the master. / / Only a master of evil, Darth Baio. / Speaking of evil, did you hear that Soleil Moon Frye and Jaleel White are getting a sitcom? / / He's not taking this seriously. / Like anyone could take "Punky 'N' Urkel" seriously. http://www.goats.com/archive/990527.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990528.html
I can't believe you, Baio. We're trying to pay homage to a sci-fi masterpiece, and all you can do is make stupid feces jokes and riff on obscure celebrities that no one cares about, you... you heretic. You cretin. Well I, for one, will not stand for it. / / That's it. I'm gone. / / I win. http://www.goats.com/archive/990528.html

How exactly does one make a sand abattoir? / That's it... Now... just turn over... yeah. / But it's so much brighter than a monitor. The sun scares me, jon. / Leave me alone. I'm on vacation. http://www.goats.com/archive/990531.html

We're going to go see "Hitler VS. Godzilla", wanna come? / Dunno. I had an extended self-pity session planned for today. / / C'mon! It's in wide-screen Hitler-vision. / He's working at the bagel shop across the street, you know. / Hitler? / / RAR! SMASH POLAND!! / Yah. He gives me extra cream cheese. / I suppose that makes up for the whole genocide thing. http://www.goats.com/archive/990607.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990608.html
The subway's not coming. / We still have 20 minutes to the curtain. Calm yourself. / And he toasted the bagel just the way I like it, too. / / I could have ridden homeless people there faster. / Hitler does not work at the bagel shop. He'd be, like, 300 years old. / You're just jealous that Hitler likes me best. / / Maybe they got lost. / Giuliani's a fascist in so many other ways, you'd think he'd be able to get the trains to run on time. http://www.goats.com/archive/990608.html

Look! Drawstring cargo pants! / / Where did you get those? / Off some guy on the floor over by the maintenance closet. He looks kinda dead. / / The coming attractions just started. / Go...

http://www.goats.com/archive/990610.html
Guess what this is. / It's an almond. / / Well, yeah, technically, but... just guess again. / It's still an almond. Do you have any more? I'm starving. / / No, idiot. It's on my right wing. Think about it. / Do they sell almonds at the movie theatre? / I think I can hear the train coming. http://www.goats.com/archive/990610.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990614.html
See, if I was making the movie, I would have pitted Hitler against someone more formidable than Godzilla. / Who's more formidable than a 200-foot lizard? / / Captain Soy! / Captain Soy? He couldn't even stop Mr. Mild from air-mailing all those babies to the Dominican Republic. / / But in the third film, it was those very babies that grew up to defeat Mr. Mild. / Ironic, wasn't it? / Like rain on your wedding day. http://www.goats.com/archive/990614.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990615.html
You guys won't believe what's under the seats. / Feels like the train is stopping. / Stopping? We can't stop now... we're so close. / / I had a dream... a dream to see a violent special effects vehicle with sub-par acting and lots of explosions. But now, it looks as though that dream will die. As will we all... this train is a deathtrap, a steel coffin, I tell you. We have as much chance of survival as a lab rat in a saccharine jacuzzi. / / Sounds like someone needs a frappuccino. / Yes.

We'll be back later. I left some snacks in the kitchen for you. / And Phillip, try not to set anything on fire. / / So. Um. Hi. / Do you have any pets? / / I... uh... I used to have some fish.

Do you know anyone whose talents might be suited towards breaking up happy couples? / Ssh. Benny Hill is on. Here's my address book. / / Can't you watch that back home? / Only reruns. And only on that snotty British channel. Feh. / / Who's this Diablo fellow? / LOL!! The man on the tricycle fell over! In fast-motion! http://www.goats.com/archive/991214.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/991215.html
Holly, I know we've only known each other a short time, but I have something to ask you. / Um... okay. / / Do you see this relationship having any kind of future? / Oh... gosh. I... yeah, why not? Sure. Why do you ask? / / Because a sentient Satan-worshipping chicken is en route on a mission to destroy our love. / Can I reconsider my previous answer? http://www.goats.com/archive/991215.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/991216.html
I can't believe you called Diablo! Why would you do that? / Let me explain. Did you know that Billy Corgan used to be on "Small Wonder"? / / What does that have to do with anything? / Nothing. But it did help distract you for a moment. / / I just flew in from the States, and boy, are my wings tired. / AGH! GAH! BLERG!! / No wonder Holly finds you attractive. You're so articulate. http://www.goats.com/archive/991216.html

40 cases of "Tastes like chicken" candy bars. / They're for my Y2K love bunker. / / Love bunker. / Yah. I'm going to hole up with a few victoria's secret models until the apocalypse is over. / / and you expect victoria's secret models to subsist on candy bars. / Of course not. I have a delivery menu from "Seoul Man" korean food. http://www.goats.com/archive/991221.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/991222.html
Whoa! Who bought the candy bars? / You can thank Toothgnip. They're for his Y2K love bunker. / / They've combined my two favorite taste sensations - Chicken and sugar! / They don't actually taste like chicken. It's just a clever marketing gimmick. / / But... but it says "tastes like chicken." It says so. / It's a misnomer. It's like that time that you went to "Nobody Beats the Wiz" in leather chaps, shouting for Michael Jackson to "take it like a man". http://www.goats.com/archive/991222.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/991223.html
Do you think Toothgnip will let me crash in his Y2K Love Bunker? / Why would you want to? This whole Y2K nonsense is overblown. / / I can bring my "Gamera vs. Llamatron" video.

They want me to press '12' for customer support. Damned if I can find the '12' button. / Maybe they have support info on their website. / / I don't know, Toothgnip. Seems to me that maybe it's time you cast off this albatross from around your neck, these damnable Panties of Potency. Maybe you don't even need them. Maybe women like you, not for your lingerie, but for who you are... who you are in your heart. / / I have a crate of grenades. / Maybe I can press '1' and '2' at the same time. http://www.goats.com/archive/991229.html

http://www.goats.com/archive/980329.html
So where did you two run into each other? / Well, we were both at MTV Studios, trying out for "Road Rules"... / / ...When suddenly, the building was under attack by mutant terrorists. My kung-fu was useless. They opened fire, and we all died. / / Diablo, don't you have somewhere to be? / Was that over the top? / Just a tad. http://www.goats.com/archive/980329.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980330.html
You look quite a bit different than the last time I saw you. / I'm a nihilist now. People expect me to look the part. / / Hence, the basic black. / Well, anything's better than dressing like a yuppie corporate slave. / / Hey. / Oh, don't get all huffy. It looks good on you...a 'conformist chic' sorta thing. http://www.goats.com/archive/980330.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980331.html
Cheryl, the last time I heard from you was right before you went off on your business trip...How come you never called? / / Well, Jon, it was on that trip that I realized I was a nihilist. Since I don't believe in love, it seemed pointless to call. / / So I take it you don't believe in celibacy? / True. But I don't believe you're getting lucky tonight either. http://www.goats.com/archive/980331.html

What's up? / I'm trying to figure out the most efficient way to win the McDonald's Monopoly contest. / / Most people would think that the best way to do it would be to write away for game pieces. Not true. It costs 64 cents round-trip, and the requests have to be handwritten. The key, my friend, is hash browns. / / Have you been sucking the propellant out of empty Easy-Cheez cans again? / Maybe. http://www.goats.com/archive/980402.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980403.html
What in the world are those? / McDonald's hash browns. Two chances to win the Monopoly contest on each one. / / You'll never win. They put out half a billion game pieces. / There's three more crates of them in the hallway. / / Half a billion, Phillip. / We'll succeed through division of labor. You peel off the game pieces, I'll eat the hash browns. http://www.goats.com/archive/980403.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980405.html
I...I found the "Boardwalk" game piece. We just won a million dollars. / Is that a good thing? / / Yes. It's a good thing. / Excellent. This is just what I need to fund my crime-fighting exploits. / / I think I just wet myself. / I'd like to thank my mom, Gallagher, and Enid, Goddess of Condiments. http://www.goats.com/archive/980405.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980406.html
We've just won a million dollars, and tax season is right around the corner. / Who can we turn to? / / When the I.R.S. rears its ugly head, you can always turn to... / Ken Hauptman, Certified Public Accountant / Able to hide money in alternate dimensions / Less crooked than some other CPAs / Never convicted of that thing you may have heard of / Can add numbers together! http://www.goats.com/archive/980406.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980407.html
Well, gentlemen, normally if someone came to me after winning a million dollars, I'd congratulate them. Unfortunately, this situation presents some problems. / / The terms of your prize state that you'll receive 4,000 yearly installments of $250. However, you owe a tax bill of $400,000.00 on the total amount in 8 days. Frankly, you're screwed. / / I suggest you prepare yourselves to spend some time in debtor's prison, or consider selling your internal organs to raise cash. / Don't let them take my liver, Jon. http://www.goats.com/archive/980407.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980408.html
Where are we going to find $400,000 to pay our income tax? / Maybe this potato can help. / What? / I think the potato has psychic powers. Maybe it can tell us what to do. / Potatoes aren't the answer to everything, Phillip. / Shh...it's trying to say something. http://www.goats.com/archive/980408.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980409.html
What's up? / I put this new accounting software on my computer so I could try to figure out how to solve our financial crisis, and it trashed my hard drive. / / I think I have an idea. I can use this Psychic Potato ? as a conduit to read the files directly from your hard drive using my mind. Think of it as psychic data recovery. / / You're beginning to scare me, Phillip. / I see a one...followed by...a zero. http://www.goats.com/archive/980409.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980410.html
If we're going to pay our $400,000 income tax bill in six days, we'd better come up with a wacky get-rich-quick scheme. / / I can run my psychic data recovery company. That'll make us money. / I can become a defense contractor. / / Those sound adequately zany. / Defense contractor? / I have fifty barrels of weapons-grade plutonium back home. http://www.goats.com/archive/980410.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980412.html
Toothgnip, we've got until Wednesday to pay our $400,000 tax bill. Diablo and Phillip are far too retarded to come up with the cash. / You don't say. / / I need you to come up with a way to earn the money, or we're screwed. Help me, Toothgnip, you're my only goat. / I'll see what I can do. / / Sex Therapy - 5? / The doctor is in. http://www.goats.com/archive/980412.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980413.html
Sex Therapy - 5? The doctor is in. / Sex therapy? / Yup. / / Sex Therapy - 5? The doctor is in. / How much for a private session? / $400,000. / / Sex Therapy - 5? The doctor is in. / Do you take cash? / It's too easy. http://www.goats.com/archive/980413.html

A Goats Editorial / Recently, critics of 'Goats' have said that we encourage minors to drink. / Not true. / / On the contrary, we here at 'Goats' support the right of parents to keep their children shrouded behind a veil of ignorance and rhetoric.

A Goats Editorial / Recently, some right-wing chicken-hating psychotics have accused me, Diablo, of being a pyronecroboviphiliac. / / Now, while it's true that I occasionally have sex with a flaming dead cow, I don't think that necessarily makes me a freak.

A Goats Editorial / A recent study had shown that too much soup can cause malaise in laboratory mice. / That's not right. / / Sure it is. / No, I mean we're supposed to be discussing the misconceptions about anal probes. / / Oh, Bob, you of all people should know that mice and anal probes don't mix. / You always have to bring that up, don't you? http://www.goats.com/archive/980416.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980418.html
Neil, I can't believe you would be so insensitive as to bring up the mouse incident. / Hey, it's not my fault that your idea of a romantic evening involves rodents and K-Y Jelly. / / Oh yeah? Well, I'm not the one with the penchant for little boys and vegetables. / At least my mom's 1-900 number isn't responsible for revitalizing the economy. / / Still paying off the medical bills for the ruptured colon. / Girls, stop it. You're both pretty. / Infidel. http://www.goats.com/archive/980418.html

It seems like you and Bob have been having some difficulties. / I just can't put up with his sexual antics, Lynda. It's getting out of control. / / Antics? / Perverse, horrid things. Gerbils. Trail mix. Patrick Dempsey movies. Leather and lubricants. / / Having a rodent fetish doesn't mean he can't be a productive member of society.

http://www.goats.com/archive/980420.html
Bob, this obsession with the mice...it's perverse. I can't deal with it anymore. I've signed you up for therapy. / Therapy? / / You can't psychoanalyze love...You can't treat romance. The boundaries of species cannot keep Fluffy and I apart. Why must you deny us our love? Why must you be so harsh, so judgmental? / / I wouldn't be so judgmental if you weren't such a sick freak. / We're eloping, you know. http://www.goats.com/archive/980420.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980421.html
Hi, Bob, I'm Dr. Frank Coffee. I'm going to be your therapist. Neil has told me you've been having some problems. / / Two hearts...torn asunder by an uncaring world...oh, the pain. / For Pete's sake, Bob, you've been shoving mice up your butt. / / Jesus, Bob, we're trying to get syndicated here! Wholesome, family plots, okay? / No newspaper will come between me and my Fluffy. / Oh lord. http://www.goats.com/archive/980421.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980422.html
What...what are you going to do with Fluffy? / It's simple, Bob. / / In order to cure you of your obsession with mice, we have to guide you through the separation process. First, we take the mouse away... / / And then we drop it in the garbage disposal. / AAH!! / Be strong, Bob. http://www.goats.com/archive/980422.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980423.html
Bob. Get up, Bob. / Never. / / You...you crushed the love of my life in a garbage disposal. Sweet, innocent Fluffy...how will I ever feel again? How will I fill this void in my soul? / / How about a trip to the Pub? / Ooh. Beer. That'll do it. http://www.goats.com/archive/980423.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980424.html
Beer's gone. / You know, that reminds me of a story from my youth...a story of loss. / / When I was but a boy, I had a stick of celery. It's name was Mr. Celery. We did everything together.

You know, I used to be intelligent...devious...a model Satanist. But, over the past year, I've felt myself become slow. Harmless.

Jon, I've come to realize that since I moved in with you and Phillip, I've become soft. Your pitiful geek lifestyles have rubbed off on me. I have to go and rediscover my Satanic roots elsewhere. / / Well Diablo, this is quite a step for you...The outside would can be harsh. Did you bring a jacket? Do you want me to pack you a bologna sandwich? / Stop patronizing me. I'm serious. / / Hey Phillip! Come see this...Our little Diablo is going off to find himself. It's so cute! / I'm not cute, dammit. I'm evil. Evil, I say. http://www.goats.com/archive/980427.html

I...I just don't think I can take it anymore. I mean, I know that compared to many, I have it pretty good. / / But I can't help but feel that there's got to be more to life...something beyond the mundane.

Pretty colors. http://www.goats.com/archive/980217.html

Four years of college. For what? A piece of paper entitling me to sit in a cube. Slaving away for a heartless corporation. Well, no more. / / I will no longer be taken advantage of! I am free!

http://www.goats.com/archive/980222.html
You realize that she's using you. She only wants your money. / Yeah, but she talked to me. / / You don't get it, do you? There's a word for people like you...created to describe the writings of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, whose stories told of people who derived sexual pleasure from pain and abuse. Do you know what that work is? / / Idiot? / Not what I had in mind, but in your case, it fits. http://www.goats.com/archive/980222.html

Did you see Jon? / I try not to. Why? / / He seems to have picked up a little golddigger. She's making him buy drinks for her and all her friends, and generally being mentally abusive, cruel and completely sapping him of any remaining self-esteem. / / She's really messing with his mind. / Dammit. That's my job. http://www.goats.com/archive/980224.html

What the hell do you want? / You're the one who's been tormenting Jon? / / Yup. What of it? / Look, you little tart, there's only one person around here allowed to cause him pain, and it's me. Now get out of my bar. / / Okay, okay. I'm gone. / Amateur. http://www.goats.com/archive/980225.html

What happened to the girl I was talking to? / I kicked her out. / / Really? Why? / I...I can't stand it when other women talk to you. / / Oh wow!

http://www.goats.com/archive/980227.html
So, what did we learn this week, Jon? / Well, Lori scared off that girl I was talking to... / / And your point is? / I think she was jealous. / / Right. And Judd Nelson might win an Emmy. / Oh, don't be silly. That would never happen. http://www.goats.com/archive/980227.html

What, pray tell, is that? / It's my new invention. / / You see, you put kittens in one end of it, and pop tarts come out the other. I'm gonna be rich. / / So, what exactly happens to the kittens? / Damned if I know. http://www.goats.com/archive/980301.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980302.html
Ooh! Strawberry with sprinkles. / So, the machine turns kittens into pop tarts? / / Well, not exactly. I think the kittens just kinda go somewhere else. / What do you mean, "You think?"

http://www.goats.com/archive/980304.html
We have to think of a way to make the humans return our engine. We must do something so evil, so heinous, that they have no choice. / Ooh! / / What? / I have an idea. We could give every human a box of assorted chocolates. / / Captain's log: the first officer is an imbecile. / Little do they know that the chocolates are filled with tasty nougat. http://www.goats.com/archive/980304.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980305.html
We must think of a plan so annoying that the humans will beg to give us our engine back. / We could hum show-tunes. / / Here is my plan...we will use the sub-light backup engines to park the ship above the city. Then, we will use the external speakers to broadcast arguments concerning the superiority of MacOS vs. Windows and vice-versa. / / Those humans who don't join either faction will become so bored by the blather that they will surrender to us. / Mom was right...you are the devious one. http://www.goats.com/archive/980305.html

Ladies and gentlemen of the press, a member of your species had stolen the engine of our spacecraft. / / If it is not returned immediately, I will be forced to bring back NBC's sitcom "Jenny" for another season. / Isn't that a bit extreme? / / Just be thankful I'm not bringing back "Perfect Strangers." / Bronson Pinchot was brilliant as cousin Balki. http://www.goats.com/archive/980308.html

Citizens of the United States of America...Our country faces a terrible threat today. Aliens have demanded that their engine be returned to them, or they will force us to watch yet another season of the NBC sitcom, "Jenny." / / As you know, the U.S. does not negotiate with terrorists. So, in order to protect our country, we are planning to nuke the aliens and all of New York back to the Stone Age.

http://www.goats.com/archive/980310.html
Phillip, you have to give the engine back to Neil and Bob. / They're lying. What kind of engine makes an unlimited supply of pop tarts? / / The kind of engine that's going to cause a nuclear war. / I hear irradiated food is good for you, anyway. / / It'll be great for the survivors. Like cockroaches. / The roaches will have to get their own pop tarts. http://www.goats.com/archive/980310.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980311.html
Gee, Neil, I'm real sorry I stole your engine. But tell me, how exactly does it turn kittens into pop tarts? / Well, that's not really how it works. / / You see, once a kitten is put into the engine, a complex process starts which places the orphan kitten with a loving caring family. The good feelings are harnessed by the engine and converted into fuel for our ship. / / So, then, if the pop tarts aren't actually made from the kittens, then how are they created? / Damned if I know. http://www.goats.com/archive/980311.html

As yet another 'Goats' adventure comes to an end, we can rest easily knowing that Neil and Bob's engine was returned... / I missed you. / / ...that millions of lives were spared, and the nuclear bombardment of New York was averted... / Dammit. / / ...and most importantly, that absolutely no kittens were harmed during the making of this series. / Sure.

It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Diablo. I'm Ms. Richards, Associate Producer of MTV's 'Road Rules.' I understand you're interested in joining that cast for next season. / Yup. / / You see, Ms. Richards, while my life so far has been rich and fulfilling, Satanism just isn't enough to make a chicken's life complete. I need to go out and see the world if I want to continue to grow.

Yesterday's episode of 'Goats' featured two panels, in which the only artwork was a pair of crudely-drawn shoes. While some readers have praised the artist for his minimalist genius, others claim he's a lazy bastard. Who's right? We'll find out today as...Readers Respond! / / He calls himself an artist? Ha! That lazy commie should be stripped naked and rubbed against Pol Pot's rotting corpse. / I don't think we should be so hard on him. I, too, know the pain of having no talent. / He's dreamy.

http://www.goats.com/archive/980607.html
Diablo, I think you should be careful at the SPCA convention. You're not exactly their favorite chicken right now. / I don't think I have any worries, Phillip. / / Look...I'm a chicken. These people are animal lovers. Think about it. / / So, wait...you're a chicken...and they do what again? / Why dontcha take a break, Phillip. We don't want you to hurt yourself. http://www.goats.com/archive/980607.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980608.html
Is this the SPCA Convention? I'm supposed to make a public apology for my insensitivity towards animals. / Yes, Mr. Diablo, we've been expecting you. / / So, let me ask you, does my apology have to be completely sincere, or can it be peppered with sarcasm and meaningless gestures? / We prefer sincerity. / / Well, how about if it's filled with general hate, loathing and derision? / Let's try again, shall we? http://www.goats.com/archive/980608.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980609.html
Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to apologize for my cruelty towards animals. But I first must say... / Psst. Hold on. / / Sorry to interrupt, but you may be interested to know that i've just been dumped by yet another woman, and I'm feeling somewhat upset. / / You are truly pathetic. / Thank you for your pity. http://www.goats.com/archive/980609.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980610.html
Ladies and gentlemen of the SPCA, I'm here to apologize for my behavior towards animals. But first, I have a dark, horrible secret to share with you all. / / THWACK / / Dammit, not again. Who cut off Diablo's head? / And just when he was about to tell us his dark secret. / Ooh! Save the entrails for me! / Who killed Diablo? Stay tuned... http://www.goats.com/archive/980610.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980611.html
I don't understand who would want to kill Diablo? / Pretty much everyone. / Never fear. Phillip's here. / / Clearly, this horrific deed was perpetrated by someone who wanted to protect themselves from the dark secret Diablo was about to reveal. I will use my uncanny deductive skills to track down the killer. / / An unnatural infatuation with Angela Lansbury doesn't qualify you for detective work. / I know. That's why I have the hat and pipe, too. http://www.goats.com/archive/980611.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980612.html
My investigation into Diablo's murder has turned up a number of seedy, vicious criminal types, each with their own sick motives for whacking the chicken. Send your leads to: tips@goats.com / Neil + Bob / Motive: Publicity stunt designed to drum up ticket sales for their roles in The X-Files Movie. / Lori / Motive: Jealous of Diablo's "Most Evil" status. / Jay / Motive: Neuronal decay after years of 'Busch Light Draft' abuse. / Howard / Motive: Mobility envy. / Jerrell / Motive: Enraged by mortal enemy Clint Howard's recently won "MTV Movie Award." / Gretchen / Motive: Chicken innards integral part of accordion worship ceremony. http://www.goats.com/archive/980612.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980614.html
I found Diablo's severed head. / And I think I found a clue as to who his killer is...this empty beer glass. / / That's your beer glass, Phillip. / True. But I also found this full bottle of beer. / / That's your bottle, Phillip. / Yeah. God, I love this detective stuff. http://www.goats.com/archive/980614.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980615.html
I know you had something to do with Diablo's murder, Jay. I'll be watching you. / You ain't got nuthin' on me, Sherlock. / / Not yet. But bad people drink bad beer. And so do you. / There's no such thing as a bad beer. / / You've got me this time. But don't expect your fancy logic to save you again. / I'll be sure to watch my step. http://www.goats.com/archive/980615.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980616.html
I still say Jay has something to do with Diablo's murder. / The only law he's broken is the German Beer Purity Law. / / Well, then, The Eggplant is clearly the murderer. / Phillip, The Eggplant doesn't even have arms. / / Thalidomide, eh? So you're saying The Eggplant has an accomplice? / I'm saying he's less of a murderer and more of a sandwich. http://www.goats.com/archive/980616.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980617.html
Hey, Lori, did you, by any chance, happen to murder Diablo? / No. / / / Are you sure? / I take it the investigation isn't going too smoothly. http://www.goats.com/archive/980617.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980618.html
Toothgnip, I can't seem to figure out who murdered Diablo. / Oh. That was me. / / Yes, Toothgnip, in a sense we're all responsible for Diablo's death. / I'm not speaking metaphorically. I cut his @!?# head off. / / The drugs...the women...we should have seen the signs. We could have done something. / Like what? Kill him again? http://www.goats.com/archive/980618.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980620.html
You didn't reall murder Diablo, did you, Toothgnip? / I sure did. / / But it wasn't why you think. Sure, he hogged the spotlight...sure, he took center stage in a feature named for me. But all this is secondary to the real reason I killed him...because he discovered my secret. / / Enough melodrama. Just tell us already. / Well, I would if I weren't being interrupted by rude people. http://www.goats.com/archive/980620.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980621.html
If you really want to understand why I killed Diablo, we have to look for answers in my past, when I was still living with Thor, God of Thunder. / / Thor kept two goats, Toothgrinder and Toothgnasher, who would pull his chariot. I was their trainee. / / Toothgrinder and Toothgnasher taught me much during our years together in Valhalla. We were like family. / You've disappointed us yet again, Toothgnip. / Yeah. You suck. http://www.goats.com/archive/980621.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980622.html
Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder taught me the ways of Asgard. / So, what's the deal? / Well, basically, we just pull Thor around in a big cart. And he occasionally eats us. / / He eats you. / Well, yes. But we regenerate. It's a bit complicated. / Hollandaise sauce has special healing powers. / / I quickly found out, however, that corporate policy didn't mesh well with my personality. / But we get the chicks right? Lotsa chicks? / No. Not really. / Lotsa hollandaise sauce, tho. http://www.goats.com/archive/980622.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980623.html
I decided to discuss my dilemma with Thor. / I'm giving you two weeks notice, Thor. / Why? / / Well, basically, I'm not happy with my benefits package. / Oh, c'mon. We offer an employer-matching 401(k). / / True, but my stock options don't vest for 5,000 years. And you eat the employees. / Did I mention our 401(k)? http://www.goats.com/archive/980623.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980624.html
Thor and I parted on good terms. / Before you go, Toothgnip, I'd like to grant you one godly power...whatever you choose. Something to give you an advantage in the mortal world. / / How about the power to pick up women in bars? / Hmm. A bit unorthodox, but okay. / / Ooh...how about the power to make celebrities spontaneously implode using only my mind? / Don't push your luck. http://www.goats.com/archive/980624.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980625.html
Thor granted my wish. / Toothgnip, these are the Panties of Potency. Wear these, and women will find you irresistable. / / Panties. / Yes. / / I suppose I'll have to wear the matching Brassiere of Badinage, too. / Do not mock the Panties of Potency. http://www.goats.com/archive/980625.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980628.html
As you already know, when I left Thor, I came to live with you two. But I still hadn't tried out my new Panties of Potency. A trip to the bar was in order. / / I remained seated at the bar so the panties wouldn't be visible. But would they work? / / Yes. / Hello ladies. http://www.goats.com/archive/980628.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980629.html
For a year after Thor gave me the Panties of Potence, life was a dream - I hobnobbed with celebrities, dated starlets...It was too easy. / / The only catch was thai I had to remain seated at all times, or someone might see the panties. / / Silly me. I always thought you sat all the time because Jon didn't know how to draw you any other way. / Shh. http://www.goats.com/archive/980629.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980630.html
Diablo slowly became suspicious of my Casanova-like behavior. / I don't get it. How does Toothgnip get all those women? / Women make me nervous. They give me an upset tummy. / / I mean, I'm just as cute. I'm definitely more active...Toothgnip just sits around all day. What gives? / Sometimes, I don't have enough time to get to the potty. / / By the Holy Groin of Lucifer, I swear I will get to the bottom of this! / But that's okay...I kinda like the squishy feeling it makes. http://www.goats.com/archive/980630.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980701.html
Diablo eventually confronted me about my strange behavior and unusual prowess. / Spill it, Toothgnip. You're a sex machine to all the chicks. How do you do it? / Hyper-pheromonal discharge. It's a genetic disorder. / / And pray tell, dear goat, why is it that we never see you stand? / Weak knees. My parents used to beat me. Tragic. / / Something doesn't quite add up here...I swear to you I will find the truth. / Stress-induced narcolepsy. Must go nap immediately. http://www.goats.com/archive/980701.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980702.html
A week later, Diablo walked in on me in the bathroom. / / So, our resident Casanova wears frilly little panties, eh? What else aren't you telling us, Toothgnip? Next thing we know, you'll be sipping bulldyke nipplewhip lattes with George Michael. / / I'm gonna sing this one to the rafters! There won't be a man, woman, or domesticated animal on earth that won't know about your cross-dressing! / And with those words, Diablo's fate was sealed. http://www.goats.com/archive/980702.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980705.html
...So after Diablo discovered my secret, I had to kill him. That's all. / What do you mean, "That's all"? What kind of ending is that? / / The kind that happened. You saw Diablo get his head cut off. / Where are the plot twists? The deception and intrigue? I'm disappointed. / / Alright, alright. So, as I'm about to kill Diablo, I'm approached by two lesbian terrorists. / Were they beautiful? http://www.goats.com/archive/980705.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980706.html
I couldn't take the risk that Diablo would tell the world my secret. That's why I had to kill him. / Of course, we both know your secret now. / / / Let's go to the pub. All the beer you can drink, my treat. / I can be bought. / Hello Heifeweizen, goodbye long-term memory. http://www.goats.com/archive/980706.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980707.html
While other comic strips claim to supply you with your daily dose of "geek humor", only Goats truly understands today's modern, upwardly-mobile geek. In this spirit, we proudly present our newest feature: / Real Geeks Don't... / / Real Geeks don't insult their bosses... / You're an idiot. / I have pointy hair. Ha ha! / / Real Geeks threaten their bosses with deadly force. / ...And I want a fresh keg of beer in my cube. Every day. / Okay. http://www.goats.com/archive/980707.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980708.html
Since we weren't contacted by Scott Adams, United Features Syndicate, or their team of soulless lawyers, we'll take that as tacit approval to bring you another episode of: / Real Geeks Don't... / / Real Geeks don't name their pets after themselves... / Meet "Frogbert." / I'll start making the plush dolls. / / Real Geeks name their pets after obscure characters from Norse mythology. / Toothnip? / Toothgnip. It's Scandinavian. http://www.goats.com/archive/980708.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980428.html
So Diablo is just gone? / Yup. He said he needed to rediscover his evil side. / / He could have just taken a look at the condition of the pub bathrooms. What could be more evil? / Well, you could be in the bathroom with a cage on your head. With a rat in the cage. A hungry rat. / / And then, after the rat is done eating your face, it orders a Bud Light. / Ooh. I'm gonna have nightmares tonight. http://www.goats.com/archive/980428.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980429.html
So, it seems that Diablo's going off to learn how to be evil. / Sounds good. Give me your beer. / / He could be off doing any number of evil things...tremendous, grandiose things, like abusing nuns, or overthrowing governments, or eating fatty foods while writing episodes of the new "Love Boat." What is Diablo doing? http://www.goats.com/archive/980429.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980430.html
Hi. I'm interested in taking an intro course in pure evil. / Well, we don't really offer a course like that. / / The closest course we have is a graduate class - Evil 503: Advanced Cruelty Theory. / Nothing for the novice? / / Well, personally, I recommend Marketing 101 and Politics 101. Both excellent refresher courses for basic evil. / Perfect. http://www.goats.com/archive/980430.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980501.html
...and that's everything on the syllabus for Evil 101: Introduction to Evil. Your total is $530.95. / Are you joking? / / You mean to tell me that I'm paying thousands of dollars to take a simple intro class, and even though the professor is a trained professional, I still need $500 in books to make up for his inadequacies? Why... thats... / / Evil? / Well, I was thinking "expensive," but I guess that's why I need a refresher course. http://www.goats.com/archive/980501.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980503.html
You know, young man, if you really want to learn about evil, you're not going to find it in a book. / / Book learnin' is for sissies and liberals. Look at me...never made it past the third grade, but I've created more evil than Hitler, and damaged more young, impressionable minds than the Power Rangers and Barney combined. / / Aaron Spelling? / Shh. http://www.goats.com/archive/980503.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980504.html
Ask away, Mr. Spelling. / Diablo, if you really want to be my apprentice in evil, I'm going to have to ask you a few questions first. / / You're going to be creating T.V. shows that don't just hurt people. These shows set back the growth of society as a whole. Can you handle that? / As long as it pays well. / / I think we can begin now, Mr. Diablo. / Good. When do we start destroying peoples' self-images with impossibly beautiful role models? http://www.goats.com/archive/980504.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980505.html
The best way to start your education is to show you slides of the various T.V. shows I've made, and explain their evil purposes. / / This first one is "The Love Boat." Not only was it vapid and brainless, but it destroyed the careers of everyone who appeared on it - sans one. / Who? / / Gopher. Damn second-rate hack is a Congressman now. / Is it too late in the season to arrange for a skiing accident? http://www.goats.com/archive/980505.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980506.html
...And with the help of a good plastic surgeon, you can turn a third-rate starlet into a teenager's wet dream. / Yawn. / / No offense, Mr. Spelling, but I'm trying to learn about evil, not second-rate T.V. show production. Where's the cruelty? Where's the dismemberment and pain? When do we learn how to crush people's souls? / / True evil comes with time and planning, Diablo, not extravagant schemes. The key is subtlety. / We don't do 'subtle' here at "Goats," Aaron. http://www.goats.com/archive/980506.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980507.html
Sayonara to Mr. Spelling. I've signed up for a class in Demonology. / Diablo, I'm saddened to hear that. He could have taught you quite a bit. / / You know, the classroom isn't the only place one can learn. Real-life experience can be very educational. / / You try summoning a demon with your 'real-life' experience, you moralizing fool. / *BURP* http://www.goats.com/archive/980507.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980508.html
I hear Jon was eaten by a demon. / Yup. / Blerg. / / / It's good to see it hasn't affected your scintillating conversations. / Yup. / Blerg. http://www.goats.com/archive/980508.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980510.html
Whatcha doin'? / Signing up for this new online dating service. / / That desperate? / Well...yes. But at least I'm assured that anyone else one here is equally desperate. / / Blerg. / Don't be so condescending...it might work. http://www.goats.com/archive/980510.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980511.html
So, what exactly is involved in this online dating thing? / It's relatively simple. / / You fill out a form on their web site, detailing your personality, your quirks, your interests. You spill your soul out for the world to see. Then, women judge you strictly on your physical stats, like so much meat. / / Sounds perfect for a masochist like yourself. / Yup. I'd save myself time and effort by scouring my eyes with a Brillo Pad. http://www.goats.com/archive/980511.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980512.html
Well, I've posted my personal ad to this online dating service's web site...Now, we wait. / Uh, Jon... / / SHH. / Jon, you may want to step away from the computer. This could take a while. / / AH! Something moved! It moved! Does it love me?! / Your cursor blinked. http://www.goats.com/archive/980512.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980513.html
Jon, you've been staring at that computer for three days now, waiting for a response to your personal ad. / Anyway, we're tired of waiting. We're gonna go ahead and continue with a new plotline. / Then we're gonna chop up your parents into little cubes, and dissolve them in industrial solvent. Is that okay with you? / Sure. Sounds good. http://www.goats.com/archive/980513.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980514.html
Jon usually comes up with the plotlines...What are we going to do this week? / How about something wholesome and family-oriented? We could have a baby. / / We're on a tight schedule, Diablo. It's not like you can just go out and buy a baby. / Already taken care of. / / Diablo... / They had a blue-light special at K-Mart. I panicked. How was I supposed to know you can't take stuff out of other people's carts? http://www.goats.com/archive/980514.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980515.html
Diablo, you didn't really steal a baby out of someone's shopping cart at K-Mart, did you? / Well, 5 babies, actually. They're really addictive. / / Please tell me that you didn't do anything stupid with them. / No, no. They're safe and sound. Just look up. / / You nailed them to the ceiling. / Hell, no. I used duct tape. http://www.goats.com/archive/980515.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980517.html
Diablo, you know I'm not much of a stickler for the rules, but I draw the line at stealing people's babies and taping them to the ceiling. You have to bring them back. / / Beer, please. / / All right, but next week we bring them back. / They should be able to do this with nachos by that point. http://www.goats.com/archive/980517.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980518.html
Yes!! Someone answered my personal ad! / / Oh, she's wonderful! We're meeting for drinks tonight. She plays the accordion, and she has hair, and she likes the Smurfs, and she's not a criminal, and...and... / / And why are there babies taped to the ceiling? / Damned if I know. Diablo? / No comment. http://www.goats.com/archive/980518.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980519.html
Diablo, why are there babies taped to the ceiling? / They climbed up there of their own free will. / / Diablo, why are there babies taped to the ceiling? / Anti-Newtonian terrorists are testing their gravity weapon in the apartment above us. / / Diablo, why are there babies taped to the ceiling? / Aren't you getting just a little bit tired of this game? http://www.goats.com/archive/980519.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980520.html
Diablo, I want those babies taken down off the ceiling before I come home from my date, okay? / Why? / / Well, it won't look good if I, you know... / If you what? Eat a monkey? Rub marshmallow fluff on your thighs? Take breakdancing lessons? / / No, I mean if...you know...if I bring my date back to the apartment. For the night. / Hey, Jon, tell me...is that shaving cream hallucinogenic? http://www.goats.com/archive/980520.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980521.html
Where's your beer, Jon? / I'm waiting until my blind date gets here. / / Good idea...then she can't tell how ugly you are. / No, no...'blind date' just means we've never met before. / / Dunno. She said she'd find me. / So how are you going to recognize her? http://www.goats.com/archive/980521.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980522.html
Uh...hi, you must be my date. I'm... / Silence!! I have no interest in you, or your llama. / / I am Gretchen Van Hooberfloosen, and this is my accordion, Heidi. You will lick Heidi. Now. Show Heidi your tongue! Or you will suffer dire consequences. / / What sort of consequences? / I am not at liberty to say, except that they will be dire, and you will suffer them. http://www.goats.com/archive/980522.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980524.html
Uh. / Silence, infidel!! Your girlish voice destroys the pure sound of my accordion. / / Now, purile eunich, you will remain silent as I play for you. You will rate my music on a scale of one to ten, in categories of size, texture, flavor, and beef by-products. / / I found my thrill...on Blueberry Hill... / Help. http://www.goats.com/archive/980524.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980525.html
Gee, well, Gretchen, it's been fun, but... / Keep your mouth shut, you infantile putrescent monkey. / / Our mating ritual has come to an end. You will now take me to your domicile and pleasure me as only a man could. You may use your man-flesh, a turkey baster, or similar toys. / / That sounds swell, but I really have to, uh...cut my toenails. / I will bite them off in the throes of our passion. Take me, yuppie boy. http://www.goats.com/archive/980525.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980526.html
Remove your clothing, you fetid pool of mucus. / Um, it's a little drafty in here. I'll keep them on, thanks. / / I said take them off...It's copulation time. Make me feel like a woman. / For the love of god, no!! / / Why are there babies taped to the ceiling? / Damned if I know. http://www.goats.com/archive/980526.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980527.html
Hey everyone! Jon did the deed with the accordion player! / I...I feel so dirty. / You disgust me. http://www.goats.com/archive/980527.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980528.html
...I mean, I'm a tremendous slut, and even I wouldn't have slept with her. / Well, she was hideous, but she had a certain something. / / Like what? Her penchant for pain? Her body odor? Her sadistic tendencies? / No, no...none of those... / / Her willingness to sleep with you? / Bingo. http://www.goats.com/archive/980528.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980529.html
What's wrong? / Gretchen just called. She doesn't want to see me again. / / It's bad enough that women run screaming when they see me. It's bad enough that 85% of my ex-girlfriends are now lesbian guerillas. But now I've been dumped by a psychotic accordion player because she's decided to date her poodle. / / Toothgnip...go get the tranquilizer darts. / It won't help...this man needs nicotine. / This is all Jerry Springer's fault!! http://www.goats.com/archive/980529.html

Chessmaster 2000 and his sidekick, Speak-and-Spell, prepare to face their greatest challenge - the Anti-Newtonian Terrorists. / Antigravity wreaks havoc on a good chess game. / / What's your plan of attack? / First, I lure them here with the tasty goodness of my bag of Funyuns ? Onion-Ring Flavored Snacks. / / Funyuns. / Oh. I seem to have eaten them all. / SPELL "FAT BASTARD." http://www.goats.com/archive/980531.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980601.html
Get down here. / Never! We, the Anti-newtonian Terrorists, scoff at your physical laws. No gravity for us! / / Ungh. / / I can't reach. / I bet you could reach if you were wearing an official "Goats" T-shirt. / SPELL "SHAMELESS PLUG." http://www.goats.com/archive/980601.html

Going to Boston was such a waste. / You didn't miss much. All we did was watch "Saving Private Ryan" a few more times. / / I'm beginning to think I'm just not capable of maintaining a relationship. / Man, that movie gets funnier every time I see it. / / I wonder if there's a class you can take in relating to other human beings. / Can we take it over the internet? http://www.goats.com/archive/990201.html

I have the wizard hamster! / Okay... everyone roll a 12-sided hamster. / / C'mon, Fluffy... Daddy needs a new pair of shoes. / What is this? / Dungeons and Hamsters. / / Thursdays we play "Hamster: The Gathering." / I didn't see any of this. / Dammit. Scooter ran away again. http://www.goats.com/archive/990202.html

My rogue hamster and my wizard hamster go in search of the elusive beefnut. / You encounter a syphillitic orc. Roll to defend yourself. / / I got a 4. / Oh, too bad.

Neil... someone has taken the hamsters. / NO!!! My sweet, sweet Fluffy! / / We must find the thieving villains. Oh, cruel fate, why must you be such a harsh mistress? / Jerrell, did you see who took the hamsters? / / Justice demands graphic, excessive, gratuitous, wanton brutal violence. / Fluffy would have wanted it that way. / Die Die Die http://www.goats.com/archive/990207.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990208.html
Hear ye! I, Bob of Gramercy, have travelled many leagues to reclaim the hamsters which are my birthright. No thieving elf, halfling, or beefnut will impede my progress. / / What have you cowardly rogues to say for yourselves? / A group of orcs is snickering at us. / / Settle down or I will be forced to kill you. / Now they're throwing popcorn at us. / clank http://www.goats.com/archive/990208.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990209.html
All right, you obfuscated orc, you leperous lemur... what have you done with my hamsters, you ferret-fellating flap-mouthed furrier! Cankerous churlish cretin. Return the hamsters, puny pox-marked puttock! / What? / / THUNK / / Now that was gratuitous. / He doesn't seem the least bit remorseful. Kill him again. http://www.goats.com/archive/990209.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990210.html
These people are remarkably uncooperative. / Not to mention rude. / / It looks like we may never find out what happened to the hamsters. / Maybe somebody ate them. / / What? / What? / Uh... I mean, DIE DIE DIE. http://www.goats.com/archive/990210.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990211.html
Great. So Jerrell ate our hamsters. What a waste of perfectly good rodents. / Not a complete waste... I think we've learned a valuable lesson. / / And what lesson might that be? / Well, if you don't know, I'm not going to tell you. / / Is this the "All supermodels should sleep with Bob" lesson we learned last time? / It's still valid. http://www.goats.com/archive/990211.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990214.html
Phillip, are these your pudding cups in the fridge? / Um... yeah. They're mine. / / Then why are they in quantum flux, alternating between states in several different planes of existence? / I like them that way. Keeps 'em fresh. / / I'm assuming you didn't purchase these at the supermarket. / Wait... they sell pudding at the supermarket now? http://www.goats.com/archive/990214.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990215.html
So you don't find anything strange about the fact that enormous quantities of pudding cups have been appearing out of thin air. / Nope. / / In your mind, there's nothing particularly ominous or foreboding about this. / Well, there's no tapioca. / / God, I can smell the foreshadowing. / Right. Like literary devices have distinctive odors. http://www.goats.com/archive/990215.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990216.html
Hand over the pudding cup, Karlsson. / Get your own, freakish troglodyte. / / That's not normal pudding, and you know it. It's evil. Put it down. / How can you attribute evil to something that tastes so good? / / It's listed in the ingredients. / Whoa. Right after riboflavin. http://www.goats.com/archive/990216.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990217.html
All I'm saying is that there's something disturbingly familiar about all this... evil... pudding... interdimensional flux... / I like pudding. / / Wait a second... do you remember the time you invented a way to transport pudding electronically, and ended up in that alternate universe? / No. / / You might want to refresh your memory. Check the archives for the "Pudding Hut" series*. / Way to segue, subtlety-boy. / *Nov. 9, 1997 - Dec. 1, 1997 http://www.goats.com/archive/990217.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990218.html
So what you're saying is that someone from the evil, alternate dimension has recreated my experiments with the pudding transfer protocol, transporting pudding cups from there to our universe? / / I knew you'd get it if I plied you with enough alcohol. / But why would someone do that? And, more importantly, who? / / I'll give you one guess, Karlsson... and it sure ain't Herve Villechaize. http://www.goats.com/archive/990218.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990221.html
HERVE VILLECHAIZE!! / HERVE VILLECHAIZE!! / No, retards. I just finished saying that I wasn't him. I'm far, far more sinister. / / RICARDO MONTALBAN!! / RICARDO MONTALBAN!! / Evil Jon. From the alternate universe. Evil... Jon. We've met before. / / MALCOLM MCDOWELL!! / MALCOLM MCDOWELL!! / I should shoot you both on principle. http://www.goats.com/archive/990221.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990222.html
So, why are you holding us at gunpoint? And why are you transporting evil pudding into our universe? / I'm not telling. / / Aw... c'mon. / Nah. I don't go in for that whole "Tell the Good Guys Your Evil Scheme Before You Destroy Them" convention. It's so cliched. / / And being an evil twin isn't? / Not when you do it with as much flair as I do. http://www.goats.com/archive/990222.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990223.html
So... um... what's the gun for? / Here... I'll show you. / / OING OING OING / thwuck / / Where the hell are we? / I don't know, but man... I look good here. http://www.goats.com/archive/990223.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990224.html
Evil Jon seems to have trapped us in some sort of crudely-drawn alternate universe. / Hey. / / Why would he do something like this? / Maybe he's plotting something monstrously evil, and needs to get us out of the way. / / Maybe Jon didn't have time to do real artwork this week. / Maybe you should keep your mouth shut. http://www.goats.com/archive/990224.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990225.html
So how are we going to escape from this alternate post-it universe? / Dunno. By the power of Greyskull? / / And I said cartoons would rot your brain. / Oh! We could construct a powerful computer made solely from the organs of horses. / / And that will help us escape. / No. But how cool would it be to have a computer made from horses? http://www.goats.com/archive/990225.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990228.html
We've got to get out of here. / Hey! Maybe we can rip through the side of the Post-It note. / / Wow. You had an actual thought. / Yeah... Scary, isn't it? / / What's out there? / Nirvana. http://www.goats.com/archive/990228.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990301.html
Phillip, that was brilliant. You got us out of the post-it universe. Congrats. / So do I get mad props? / / Mad props? / Mad props. / / Depends. What's a prop? / Haven't a clue. Can you go get me some scuba gear? http://www.goats.com/archive/990301.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990302.html
Well, we're free. Now we have to find a way to return to our normal size. / I dunno... I kinda like it like this. / / Oh, c'mon. We're smaller than jon's chances of getting a date with a vertebrate. / We're smaller than jon's self-esteem after a trip through the dryer. / / Smaller than jon's social skills in a trash compactor. / Smaller than jon's jock str... / Enough, gentlemen. http://www.goats.com/archive/990302.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990303.html
Jon! What happened to you? / My evil twin trapped me in a cocktail napkin at the other end of the bar. / / Sure he did. How come we never see the two of you together? / How come your head is so large? / / Wake me up when you two nimrods are done. / Someone here needs a 12-step program for schizophrenics. / At least I don't have to attend a big head support group. http://www.goats.com/archive/990303.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990304.html
Great. Evil Jon has the run of the place, we're 4 inches tall, and I'm not attracted to short women. Things can't get any worse. / Yes they can. / / How so? / She's... she's back. / Fabulous. More plot complications. http://www.goats.com/archive/990304.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990307.html
Lori? / You got some 'splaining to do Rosenberg. You and your little chicken friend. / / Interesting... you seem to have quite a temper. Very much unlike your counterpart from my universe. / Temper? After being crated and shipped off to Zimbabwe? Me? / / The level of sarcasm is also somewhat higher. / It's not the sarcasm you need to be worried about. It's the homicidal bent. http://www.goats.com/archive/990307.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990308.html
It took me three months to make my way back here. I had to sleep in the jungle. I had to eat bugs. I had to wear GAP clothing, jon. And the only thing that kept me going was the thought of destroying your beady-eyed chicken friend. / / Very nice. Now shut up and sit down. You're disturbing the pudding. / The pudding's not the only thing that's disturbed. What have you been putting in that stuff? / / Evil. Want some? / I suppose revenge can wait. You have an extra spoon? http://www.goats.com/archive/990308.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990309.html
Pudding is the only substance that is transdimensional by nature. It can be used as a catalyst to transport other objects through dimensional rifts. But it has to be 'tuned' to the universe it's interacting with. Hence, evil pudding can be used as a transdimensional vehicle for the movement of evil-universe objects. / / I don't follow. / In layman's terms, evil objects can use the energy of the pudding to get to places they couldn't on their own. / / Oh! Kinda like how Ed McMahon used Johnny Carson. / True. But Ed doesn't taste quite as good. http://www.goats.com/archive/990309.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990310.html
So what are you gonna do with all this evil pudding, anyway? / Well, the details are somewhat complex, but it's your basic world-domination-type thing. / / You know, maybe it's just the pudding talking, but there's something different about you, Jon... / Give me some sugar, baby. / / He's kissing her!?? / Amongst other things. Wow. Can he do that in a family-oriented comic strip like ours? / Man... I gotta get me some zucchini. http://www.goats.com/archive/990310.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990311.html
If Evil Jon wants to take over the world, that's one thing... but to seduce Lori by pretending to be me is unacceptable. We're going to have to fight evil with evil. / Why don't we fight evil with parsnips? / / Because that's stupid. / Not as stupid as you may think. The parsnip was invented by Edward Parsnip in 1953 as a response to the encroachment of communism in eastern Europe. The parsnip remains one of our primary weapons in the "Cold War" of today. / / And I imagine this has some relevance to our situation. / Nah. I just like to say "parsnip." / Man... I gotta get me some parsnips. http://www.goats.com/archive/990311.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990314.html
If we're going to stop Evil Jon, we're going to need help. / If you call him, you might as well ask him to sign us up for discount coffins. That freak is useless. / / 25? / For Local / For Long / Dial 1 / Dial / Oh, c'mon... he'll help us. Most of what he does is just an act. Underneath is all, he's just as normal as the rest of us. / / Ring Ring http://www.goats.com/archive/990314.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/981213.html
And then, after I close all the breweries, everyone will be forced to drink wine coolers! / You know, cheese really stinks when it goes bad. / / Despite all your evil scheming, Cheese, you've forgotten one thing... Goats are the natural enemy of all dairy products. / / That's not true. / Well, technically it's not true, but we'll assume it is for the purposes of this conversation. http://www.goats.com/archive/981213.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981214.html
...so once Frank Coffee had distracted your lawyers, it was a cinch to sneak in here. / But I still have your friends captive. Your plan was for naught. / / So you think. But I'm here to challenge you to a fight... a battle in the ancient art of araygun. / What's araygun? / / BRAAP / This is. / Crispy fries. http://www.goats.com/archive/981214.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981215.html
Face it... his brain is toast. / It's just the shock of seeing the bar like this. He'll be fine. / / ...and it'll be just like it used to be. We'll have huge glasses of Heifeweizen. You've got your sheepskins on. And the boots I made for you. / / You'd do it if you really cared about him. / Look. You want to euthanize him, you administer the injection. http://www.goats.com/archive/981215.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981216.html
I made you a holiday card 'cause your bar blew up and now you're unemployed. / That's very sweet of you. / / a small child will be sacrificed in your name on the winter solstice. / happy holidays! / love, diablo / / Thank you, Diablo. It's just what I wanted. / I made it all by myself. http://www.goats.com/archive/981216.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981217.html
I just got off the phone with Lynda. She says it'll be about two months until they rebuild the pub. / / Well, I think it's important to remember, especially at this time of year, that we don't need physical things like beer or pubs. We have each other, and that's enough for me. / / Prozac. Need Prozac. / Oh, c'mon. I was kidding. / Kill me. http://www.goats.com/archive/981217.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/981220.html
Prozac? Grape-flavored. Chewable. Mmm. / Nuh-uh. That stuff's not for me. / / Makes me nervous that it might... well... you remember that episode of Star Trek where Captain Kirk is split into Evil Kirk and Good Kirk, and Good Kirk loses the ability to command the Enterprise effectively? / / Yeah. / Man, that was a good episode. http://www.goats.com/archive/981220.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981221.html
Well, if the pub isn't going to be open for the next few months, we'll have to find a new bar. / Blasphemer. / / It wouldn't kill you to try something new, y'know. / How come we always do what you want? What about my ideas? / / You can't induce suspended animation with frozen margaritas. / You and your "facts" and your "physics". Pah, I say. http://www.goats.com/archive/981221.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981222.html
We're all going. So stop complaining. / But the Amish give me hives. / Why do I have to go? / / Because the Amish country is rustic, and relaxing, and we need something to do while the bar is closed. / And we can make lots of cheap jokes at the expense of a group that can never find out about it. / / I'd like to think we're above that sort of behavior. / And I'd like to stay home, but that also seems unlikely. / I bet Amish chicks are easy. http://www.goats.com/archive/981222.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981223.html
Jon, Toothgnip keeps trying to touch my special area. Make the bad man stop. / Like I would go near anything that smelled as much as decapitated hamsters as you do. / / Can we put the top down? It's freezing. / / It's disgusting, Jon. He's growing tumescent as we speak. / At least I'm not humping the back of the seat. / It's a chicken thing. You wouldn't understand. / / Amish Country / 346 mi. / Well, this trip is rapidly becoming a non-stop crap-o-rama. / Are we there yet, Jon? / Yes. Get out. http://www.goats.com/archive/981223.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981224.html
Toast? / Oh yeah. The spark plugs have been partially eaten, and there are beak-marks everywhere. / / We're in the middle of nowhere. What should we do? / Just wait, I guess. It could be more than a week until we're rescued. / / Say, on January 4? / Sounds about right. http://www.goats.com/archive/981224.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990103.html
More upholstery? / Nah. I'm busy. / / Another new invention? / Behold, the compact steakhouse! It's the first steakhouse you can keep in your pocket. / / How much paste did you eat in kindergarten, Phillip? / Milk may build strong bones, but adhesives are cement for the mind, Jon. http://www.goats.com/archive/990103.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990104.html
Do you have a flat, gray pebble? / Go fish. / / Hey, guys! I see one of those Amish horsedrawn buggies coming down the road. We're saved! / / Show a little leg, Jon. Maybe they'll pick us up. / Yeah. Go get 'em, tiger. / I have been working on firming up my calves. / This is going to cause weeks of nightmares. http://www.goats.com/archive/990104.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990105.html
Twas kind of you to pick up those boys at the side of the road, Ezekiel. / Ayuh. / / They seem like decent folk. / Ayuh. / / And if the injection takes hold quickly, we can grab their wallets. / Do they even use money? / I think they trade in pickles or eggs or something. http://www.goats.com/archive/990105.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990106.html
You'll be sleepin' out in the barn. You kin take the blankets from off the horses. / Thank you, Ezekiel. You've been a great help. / / 'Tweren't nothing. I'll be waking you at dawn, so get some rest. We'll be havin' your livestock for breakfast. / Um. / Ssh. Just go with it. / / Bed of lettuce, my ass. Some hotel this is. How the hell do you turn on the "Magic Fingers"? / Hey baby. http://www.goats.com/archive/990106.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990107.html
And what is this evil device? / It's a Walkman. / / It emits a strange sound. / That's Billy Idol. "Cradle of Love" is the anthem of my generation. / / And what does this button do? Summon Satan? / Sadly, no. http://www.goats.com/archive/990107.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990110.html
Thanks for letting us stay here, Ezekiel. / My pleasure... Must be good to get away from all that city-stress, what with your ex-girlfriend getting engaged. / / What?! Huh? / Oh... I thought you knew. Celia, your college sweetie, is getting married. / / Why am I always the last one to hear about this sort of thing? / I heard from Zachariah's wife, down the way. http://www.goats.com/archive/990110.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990111.html
Celia and I were together for years... she guided me into manhood, much like a proctologist might guide an endoscope through a polyp-ridden duodenum. And now, she's marrying some... some troglodyte. / / Damn. / Ayuh... 'tis a shame. She could be quite a wild mistress in the bedroom. / / What? / Nothing. http://www.goats.com/archive/990111.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990112.html
I have to stop her. I have to get to Boston. / Jon, you haven't talked to Celia in years. Get on with your life. / / Phillip, she's getting married. She can't! She said she'd be with me always. / Except for all that time since you graduated college, of course. / / We're on a break. / A four-year break. http://www.goats.com/archive/990112.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990113.html
But I do want Celia back. Really I do. / Jon, you do remember why you're not with her anymore, right? / / She kissed another boy. / The horror! / And do you remember what happened then? / / I tried to kill Daisy Fuentes, Downtown Julie Brown, and Kennedy. / So it's safe to assume that your responses to stressful situations like these aren't entirely rational, yes? http://www.goats.com/archive/990113.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990114.html
Fine, already. I won't go to Boston. I won't try and stop my ex-girlfriend from getting married. / Good. / Good. / Good. / / I'm just going to stay here and... uh... go over by the door... so I... uh... I can watch out for monkeys. Attack monkeys. That might attack us. If I'm not by the door. / / Snare traps? / Set up all along the perimiter. / Set up all along the perimeter. / Release the hounds. http://www.goats.com/archive/990114.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990118.html
Hey, little girl... slow down. I need some help. / Mommy told me not to talk to strangers. / / You don't have to talk to me. You just have to let me commandeer your Big Wheels. Okay? / / Mommy told me not to cross the street. / To hell with mommy. To the train station! GO! GO! GO! http://www.goats.com/archive/990118.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990119.html
Stalking or no stalking? / Stalking, please. / Can I go to Boston too? / / Don't you have to go to school or something? / I... um... I'm not going 'cause mommy told me to go look at business schools. In Boston. They have those in Boston, right? / / How old are you? / Don't make me go back there. If I have to watch "Teletubbies" one more time, I'll have an embolism. http://www.goats.com/archive/990119.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990120.html
...so I'm going to Boston to keep Celia from marrying a troglodyte. / Even though you haven't dated her for four years? / / Well, um, that's technically accurate. / It seems to me that you focus on your "safe", failed relationship in an effort to avoid redirecting your energy towards establishing a potentially risky, new one. / / All right, little girl, any more psychoanalysis from you and the bear dies. / No! Don't hurt Teddy! http://www.goats.com/archive/990120.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990121.html
It's pretty obvious, Jon. You're purposely sabotaging your relationships because you're afraid they won't measure up to what you had with Celia, the archetype of all your future relationships. / No, I'm not. / / Yes you are. / I said, No I'm not. / / Vehemently denying it doesn't make it any less true. / Yes it does. http://www.goats.com/archive/990121.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990124.html
Hi. Celia. Hi. / Jonny? / / Hi. / Jonny, what are you doing in Boston? For that matter, what are you doing here? / / Um... hi. / Ah... there's the eloquence that swept me off my feet all those years ago. http://www.goats.com/archive/990124.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990125.html
So, uh... what's new? How's medical school? Get engaged lately? / Jonny, who's this adorable little girl? / / Oh, her? This is Emily. She's... uh... I'm babysitting. For Emily. / He kidnapped me and made me come to Boston. / / God, I love kids. / And then he tried to kill my teddy bear. / I take it you've stopped your therapy, Jonny. http://www.goats.com/archive/990125.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990126.html
Celia... I... I'm here to tell you that you can't get married. / Oh? And why not? / / You know... because of that reason. The one that escapes me at the moment. / This is endearing, Jonny, but the timing is awful. / / You can't get married... because Emily is our child! / I am? / I'm pretty sure I would have remembered that. http://www.goats.com/archive/990126.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990127.html
Please, Celia, don't get married. / This isn't the sort of thing you can fix with good manners, Jonny. I'm marrying him because I love him. / / Pretty please? / No, Jonny. No. I'm serious... you're making me uncomfortable. / / How about 'pretty please' and $4.35... $4.40 in change? / Most of that is pocket lint, Jonny. http://www.goats.com/archive/990127.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990128.html
...and the Surgeon General is always saying how marriage is bad for you. / My fiance is on his way home, Jonny. You should probably be leaving. / / Don't marry him, Celia. I... I still love you. / He's coming home from kickboxing lessons. / / Well, look at the time. / It was great to see you again, Jonny. http://www.goats.com/archive/990128.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990131.html
...so she begged me to get back together with her, but I had to say no. / Uh-huh. / / Well, you've done wonders with the bar while I was gone. / The construction crews finished last week. / / What's with the human skulls over the restrooms? / Interior decoration by Diablo. http://www.goats.com/archive/990131.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980814.html
Hey, Diablo, Phillip was saying that...um. / / / I didn't see a thing. / Hey, can you grab me a Coke from the fridge? http://www.goats.com/archive/980814.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980816.html
Gentlemen, a dark day has arrived in 'Goats' history, a day we knew would come. The Comics Board has targeted us for cancellation. However, we have decided to fight back. / / During the next week, I'll brief you on the status of out enemy, the time-travelling, gelatin-based enforcement group known as "The Board," and their evil leader, Bill Cosby. Are there any questions before we begin? / / Will there be punchlines? / No. There will be no levity during the briefing. http://www.goats.com/archive/980816.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980817.html
Today, we'll be briefing you on our enemy, the Comics Board. What little info we have was gathered for us by Bob, who has been on a secret recon mission. / Hey. / / The origins of the Comics Board lie in the upcoming Gelatin Wars of 2034, which were the result of a very aggressive Jello marketing campaign. / Eat Jello or die. / / As hunter-killer robots lay waste to the Northern Hemisphere, resistance groups searched for a way to fight. Their only effective weapon: old, stale, re-used party jokes. / ...So, the other guy says, "Hey, you think I asked for a 12-inch pianist?" http://www.goats.com/archive/980817.html

...While the Jello Corporation's hunter-killer robots decimated the surface, resistance cells gathered beneath the rubble. There, they perfected their weapon: tired party jokes. / "To get to the other side?" I don't get it. / / But the guerrilla tactics of the Resistance did not go unnoticed. Executives at Jellocorp were quick to plan countermeasures. / / You see, what we need, you see, is weasels.

Though reduced to a hovering, evil brain by the ravages of time, Bill Cosby never lost the one talent that had helped him turn Jellocorp into the war machine it became in 2034: the ability to utterly crush his enemies. / / His nefarious scheme: create an army of hyperintelligent, robotic warriors in the form of the one creature whose sense of humor is so poor, it would be immune to any jokes. / / Enter: the weasel. http://www.goats.com/archive/980819.html

New! From Jellocorp / Weasel 5000 / For all your rebellion-crushing needs, the Weasel 5000 is outfitted with redundant logic-conflict processors, for maximum resistance to all humor-based attacks. Crush your enemies today. / Even the simplest humor sends the Weasel 5000 into a violent rage. / Free side of beef with every weasel! / Comic strip artists? Mimes? Prop comedians? No problem!

With the introduction of the Weasel 5000, the tides of the Jellocorp War of 2034 had turned. The humor attacks of the Resistance were no longer effective. But Bill Cosby, C.E.O. of Jellocorp, would not be satisfied until they were totally eliminated. / ...So the bartender says, "Gee, Superman, you're a real bastard when you're drunk." / / You see, we send the weasels back in time, you see.

http://www.goats.com/archive/980824.html
In an effort to completely eradicate the Resistance, Jellocorp sent their finest, most humorless android weasels back in time. Their mission: to eliminate all sources of humor from existence, thereby denying their enemies a weapon. The weasels easily infiltrated our society, quietly blending in... / Time Machine / Zap! / / ...as comic strip syndicate editors. / Renew 'Garfield' and 'Cathy' for another five years...and get this 'Goats' crap off my desk. http://www.goats.com/archive/980824.html

Oh, c'mon...how could you possibly want to spend time anywhere else? / I'm bored here. / / But the pub has everything necessary to sustain life.

http://www.goats.com/archive/980903.html
The women...the constant, wild sex...the parties. It just doesn't bring me joy anymore. I need fulfillment. I need to find my place in the cosmos, Jon. It's time for me to settle down...maybe raise a family. / / You can't do it, Toothgnip...it would be a travesty. Your playboy lifestyle is a source of hope for all of us. If you can't handle it, what are our chances? / / I don't really think your chances and my chances are comparable, Jon. / What's that supposed to mean? http://www.goats.com/archive/980903.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980904.html
Toothgnip's acting weird...keeps talking about settling down. / Nah. He'll never do it. / I know how to stop him. / / First, we strap a large amount of antimatter to his back. Then, if any women approach him, we spray them with...uh...matter. Any contact will result in death. / / Antimatter. / Wait a second, Jon. The chicken might have something here. / Yes. Obey the chicken. http://www.goats.com/archive/980904.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980907.html
Maybe...maybe Toothgnip's got the right idea. Maybe we have settled into a mundane pattern...trading growth and accomplishment for easy comfort. Maybe spending all this time in a bar is time that could be spent finding fulfillment and purpose. / / Are you talking again? What did I tell you about that? / All I'm saying is that our lives could use some variety and spontaneity. / / Hey guys. Cheryl and I just got engaged. / I'm going to kill you as soon as the arrhythmia subsides. / Variety, huh? http://www.goats.com/archive/980907.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980908.html
Toothgnip, how could you do this to me? How could you get engaged to Cheryl? / I was bored. / / You knew how I feel about her. And you still went ahead and crushed my dreams. / Were you currently using these alleged dreams? / / Well, no, not technically... / Can we do this later? "Dawson's Creek" is starting. http://www.goats.com/archive/980908.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980909.html
So let me get this straight...first, you blow me off completely. Months later, you show up and tell me we can't be together 'cause you're a nihilist, and don't believe in love. Now, you're suddenly engaged to my pet goat. / / Jon, calm down. This has nothing to do with you. / Oh yeah? So nihilists don't believe in love, but they do believe in marriage? / / Well, we don't believe in not getting married. / This is a very convenient philosophy you have here, isn't it? http://www.goats.com/archive/980909.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980910.html
I can't believe they're engaged. / You are so pathetic. Why do you even care? / / You haven't seen this Cheryl person in months. In the meantime, I've seen you drooling over dozens of women, including yours truly. Now that she's engaged, you're a mess. You don't care about her. You're just an emotional slut. / / LA LA LA...I CAN'T HEAR YOU...LA LA... / Slut. Slut. Slut. http://www.goats.com/archive/980910.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980911.html
You're mad...mad, I tell you. / Am I? One of your closest friends and a girl you claim to care about have found love. Why aren't you happy for them? / / Wait a second, Lori...why the sudden interest in how I feel? / I just get a kick out of pointing out your moral flaws. / / Oh my...you're jealous of my feelings for Cheryl, aren't you? / The reflecting pool is outside, Narcissus. http://www.goats.com/archive/980911.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980913.html
You know, Lori, you're really cute when you're jealous. / You disgust me. / / Five minutes ago, you were lamenting the loss of your dearest Cheryl. A few words from me, and you've completely forgotten her. What kind of sick, perverse, fickle psychopath are you? / / It's adaptive behavior in the grandest Darwinian tradition. / Let's see how well you adapt to this month's bar tab. http://www.goats.com/archive/980913.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980914.html
Why so sad, Jon? / Cheryl and Toothgnip just got engaged. / / Cheer up, buttercup. I know how to get that goat. We'll put a curse on them...all their offspring will have the bodies of humans, but the legs of a goat. They'll be like those...those mythological things. / / Satyrs. / Yeah, those. Brilliant, huh?

Hello, Toothgnip. / Thor? What the hell are you doing here? / / I heard about your upcoming nuptials, and wanted to congratulate you.

...So Thor says that he's going to take back my "Panties of Potency" when I get married to Cheryl. Jon, this is horrible! No more unlimited babes. No more Victoria's Secret models. No more group sex. / / So? Toothgnip, you're getting married. You won't need the Panties. / Why not? / / Do you even know what marriage entails, Toothgnip? / Yeah. Hot meals and laundry. But apparently the loss of lingerie also plays a role. http://www.goats.com/archive/980916.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980917.html
Thor's gonna take away my "Panties of Potency." / T'sokay. We can take him. / / Take him? He's a god, Diablo. / So what? Last week, I was bowling with the God of Potatoes.

http://www.goats.com/archive/980921.html
...So, if we get married, Thor says that he's going to take away my "Panties of Potency," a magic pair of women's underwear that gives me the power to pick up women in bars. / / So, as you can see, I'm stuck with a bit of a dilemma. / / Let me get this straight...you're telling me that you're a cult-worshipping, delusional, womanizing cross-dresser, and you're the one who's going to call off the wedding? / Sounds about right. http://www.goats.com/archive/980921.html

And you're okay with this? / What, that Jay and Lori were kissing? Why wouldn't I be okay? / / Because you have an unnatural obsession with her. You're borderline psychotic. / Oh. That. / / Beer? / Sure... that would be an appropriately passive-agressive course of action. http://www.goats.com/archive/981102.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981103.html
You do realize that your little fling with Jay is killing Jon... he's in severe denial. / That's half the fun. / / But why Jay? He's an oversexed neanderthal. / Not necessarily. There's more to him than people give him credit for. / / ...and if you move your fingers in a clockwise direction, she'll bark like a dog. / Hold on. http://www.goats.com/archive/981103.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981104.html
...so, you'll pick me up at 7:30 sharp. Bring flowers. Dinner should be $70 per person. / Uh-huh. / / / Eyes up. / Just a sec. http://www.goats.com/archive/981104.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/981105.html
You're two hours late for dinner, Jay. / It's okay. I already ate. / / Well, it's too late to do anything now. 'Felicity' is on in fifteen minutes. / Ooh! Sex! What about sex? / / Oh, I suppose that would be okay. Can you make it quick? / There's no right answer to that, is there? http://www.goats.com/archive/981105.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981108.html
Jon, we need to talk. / Gah. / / You're my friend, Jon, and I'm not blind to the pain my relationship with Lori has been causing you. / Gah? / / That's why it's so difficult for me to tell you how absolutely, stunningly incredible she is in bed. I'm sorry. Really. / Gah. http://www.goats.com/archive/981108.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981109.html
Ever since Lori started dating Jay, Jon's been a depressive mess. / Yeah. Isn't it great? / / He's stopped bringing home those little marshmallow treats. / The ones with the nougat center? / / Mmph. / She must be stopped. http://www.goats.com/archive/981109.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981110.html
Pardon me, Lori, but I seem to have spilled my beer on the floor over there. Can you clean it up? / / By that "x" painted on the floor? / Yes. / / And under that cow? / Yes. http://www.goats.com/archive/981110.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981111.html
Guys... I need your help. / What can we do for you, Diablo? / / The bartender... the one they call Lori. She must be eliminated. / Have you tried dropping a cow on her? / / Of course. But she saw right through my nefarious plot. / She's a cunning one. / I'll get more cows. http://www.goats.com/archive/981111.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/981112.html
So, how are we going to get rid of Lori? / Here's the plan... first, we dress Bob up like a pirate. / / Then, I will read her the lusty sonnets of Sylvia Plath until she swoons and yields to my every whim. / / And how is this going to help our cause? / It won't. But I get to make hot monkey love to Lori. / And I get to be a pirate! Arrr!! http://www.goats.com/archive/981112.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981115.html
How goes it? / We'd have a finished plan if he didn't keep making changes. / He's just scared of innovation. / / I wouldn't call replacing the phase inducer with an electric eel innovative. / An adult electric eel can stun an entire Ed Begley, Jr. / / I'll be on the couch. / Let's keep our little infatuations to ourselves, shall we? / I don't like your tone, mister. http://www.goats.com/archive/981115.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981116.html
...so on three, we rush the bar. / Do we have a battlecry? / I think I see something. / / We don't need a battlecry. Just grab the woman. / How about "Au bon PAIN!!" / Looks like a potato. / / We're abducting a bartender, not beating mimes with baguettes. / We could do that afterwards. / Nope. It's not a potato. False alarm. http://www.goats.com/archive/981116.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981117.html
Jeez, Bob, I think it's time you laid off the Snickers. Ngh. / Damn mimes. / I am NOT a mime. / That's exactly the sort of thing a mime would say. / What the hell is going on over there? / I don't see a thing. http://www.goats.com/archive/981117.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981118.html
Something... something doesn't feel quite right. / A disturbance in the Force? / / It's as if a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders... as if a pain that's haunted me for years is suddenly gone. / Oh. Um... I'm sure it's nothing. / / Do not open ever / Lori in a box / Sign here. http://www.goats.com/archive/981118.html

What happened to your talk show, Diablo? / The guests are just far too bizarre. I'm sticking to what I know best - ideology. / / So what are you reading? / Karl Marx. The man had some interesting ideas. Listen to this - "Religion is the opiate of the masses." / / Isn't opium the opiate of the masses? / Hey...you're right.

You see that woman at that table over there, Phillip? She wants you. You want her too, don't you? / Yes. / / She likes men who throw lima beans at her, Phillip. You should throw lima beans at her.

Phillip's been acting strangely. / And Steven Seagal likes little boys.

Maybe Phillip's not responsible for his actions. Maybe he's been posessed by an evil spirit, or a demon. / / Look, I don't buy into that pseudo-religious claptrap.

We can exorcise Phillip's demon by summoning a second demon to evict the first from his body. / How? / / A simple potion.

So, this mixture will help us evict the demon from Phillip's body? / Just slip this into his drink. He should become drowsy and relaxed. / / And then what? / Dim the lights. Compliment him on his dress. Play some Manilow. / / And then what? / Just do whatever comes naturally. You're a big boy, Jon. Haven't your parents talked to you about this? http://www.goats.com/archive/981019.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981020.html
I don't like it. / You want to help Phillip, don't you? / / I don't think we're going to have to trick him. / Yeah, but tricking him into drinking your demon-potion seems a bit backhanded. / / You can have this beer, Phillip, but it's going to cause demonic posession. / Yeah. Whatever. Beer. Gimme. http://www.goats.com/archive/981020.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981021.html
Don't drink it, Phillip. You'll be posessed by a demon... a demon bent on eradicating me. You don't want that, do you? / I... I can't help it... the beer... too powerful... / / Don't do it! For the love of God, no!! Oh, what a world... what a world... / GLUG / GLUG / GLUG / GLUG / / Great. A demon in the form of Mace Windu, Jedi Master, as protrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. / May the Force put a cap in yo ass, bitch. http://www.goats.com/archive/981021.html

Normally, you would be dead as *@!?ing fried womp rat by now, but since I'm in a transitional period, I don't want to kill your ass. / / Aren't you here to get rid of me? / Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.

http://www.goats.com/archive/981023.html
Did it work? Did our demon exorcise Phillip's other demon? / Too soon to tell. / / Can you imagine what sort of epic battle must be going on in his mind? He'll probably have an embolism from the psychic turbulence. / One can only hope. / / Do you have any threes? / Go fish. http://www.goats.com/archive/981023.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/981025.html
Hey guys. / Phillip! You're okay! How do you feel? / / Thirsty. Where's my beer? / Any after-effects from your demonic posession? / / "None at all. I'm fine, guys." / None at all. I'm fine, guys. http://www.goats.com/archive/981025.html

Jon... Toothgnip and I are going to interview for that job from the want ads. / / / Jon. I need a punchline. / Hm Brooke Shields beer chicken headszz.. http://www.goats.com/archive/980113.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980114.html
Hey baby. We're here for the job interview. / Dr. Coffee will be right with you. Please have a seat. / / Ooh! Look...magazines! / I think the receptionist wants me. / / Cool. They have a subscription to "Vivisection Weekly." / I can tell by the way she was fondling her clipboard. http://www.goats.com/archive/980114.html

Hello, Mr. Diablo, my name is Dr. Frank Coffee. Um... where's you little goat friend? / He's having sex with the receptionist. / / That's nice. Diablo, I can't tell you how pleased I am that you're applying for a job here at Unnecessarily Cruel Medical Testing Labs. But I have to ask you a few standard questions. / / First, do you have any allergies to, say, being cut up into tiny, tiny bits? / Why, is that the sort of thing you're likely to do? http://www.goats.com/archive/980115.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980117.html
Diablo, I need to know if you're going to be able to get to work in a timely fashion. Do you live in the city? / Downtown. With two alcoholics and an oversexed goat. / / That's nice. Do you have any previous work experience? / I am a general in the Army of Satan, my lord and uncle. / / Well, I understand that military experience builds character. Do you have any questions for me? / How's your 401(k) plan? http://www.goats.com/archive/980117.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/980118.html
Well, Mr. Diablo, I see no reason why you can't start work immediately. I'll tell the receptionist to bring in the appropriate paperwork. / / She doesn't seem to be picking up the line. / / Will you call me? / Sorry, babe. Hooves and touch-tone phones don't mix. http://www.goats.com/archive/980118.html

Bob! Uh...I mean Biff! Bring me the Clone-O-Matic 5000! Once we clone the chicken, we can begin our evil plan. / / / I am a professional. I demand better props than an eggplant.

http://www.goats.com/archive/980126.html
You're stopping the series? / The cloning thing just isn't working. It's a simple matter of economics. / / One of the basic tenets of Advanced Chicken Humor Theory states that each additional chicken is only half as funny as the previous chicken. It's a simple case of diminishing returns. / / So an infinite number of chickens only supplies two chickens worth of humor. / And they say thought is impossible without a brain. http://www.goats.com/archive/980126.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/980127.html
What? / I can't believe you cancelled the cloning series. / / We've been working on it for eons, and you're just cutting it short 'cause you can't think of an ending. / / Okay, okay. We'll do an extra "butt" joke next week. / Ooh! And I get to nail that Lewinsky chick. http://www.goats.com/archive/980127.html

You mean to tell me that our resident chicken just sits home all day, and doesn't contribute to our rent? Diablo is going to have to start working. / / Why?

Diablo, we just can't keep squandering your share of the beer money on rent. You're going to have to get a job. / / I could be a makeup consultant for transvestite lemurs. Ooh!

http://www.goats.com/archive/971121.html
This is a public relations disaster. We've transported our customers into the pudding silos. / I think I can fix it. / / Diablo! Get down from that pudding silo. / The computer doesn't understand the pudding. I must teach it about the pudding. / / Diablo, get down here now! And stop gnawing on that man's leg.

Jon, something horrible has happened! During my Pudding Transfer Protocol tests, I accidentally combined the pudding with a housefly! / Oh my god. / / I saw something just like this in a movie once. Before you know it, the fly will start vomiting acid on us. Then, Geena Davis will divorce us, we'll develop and unhealthy fixation on chaos theory, and be eaten by dinosaurs. / / Nah.

Wow, this alternate universe sure is a wacky place! I wonder what will happen next? / Wow. / Hi boys. / / We were just passing by and we saw you two virile handsome men standing here. / Would you two be interested in getting a drink? / / Nothing I have experienced has adequately prepared me for this moment. / Or we can skip the drink and just have sex. http://www.goats.com/archive/971126.html

All right. This place is getting a little weird now. / Ah, Jon. We finally meet. Perhaps I should explain. / / During your experiments with the Pudding Transfer Protocol, we sensed an opportunity to bring you over... to the BIZARRO UNIVERSE... A place where all that you are familiar with is reversed. I am your equivalent on this plane. / / So, then, where's my evil twin? / He's down at the pub drinking beer. Some things are constants in all planes of existence. http://www.goats.com/archive/971127.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971129.html
All this alternate universe stuff is making me thirsty. / So, what exactly is this place? / I'll explain it again for the thought-impaired. / / There are an infinite number of planes of existence. On this plane, the bizarro universe, things are the exact opposite from your plane. For example, in this universe, I'm a captain of industry, socially skilled, and desired by all women. / / So, if you're the opposite of me, why is your hair the same as mine? / Don't get into technicalities with me, boy. I'll send you to the "Busch Light" universe. http://www.goats.com/archive/971129.html

Excuse me, uh, fish, but what is this? / That's Detective Fish to you. And it's a warrant for your arrest, you fish racist. / / Yesterday, you were seen using the phrase "Attention span of a fish." This epithet shows... uh. Something. Yes. Maybe. Is it warm in here? / / Aren't you a bit far from your bowl, little fish? / Ooh... I miss my fishbowl. It has water in it. And gravel. I like gravel. http://www.goats.com/archive/971204.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971205.html
Have you seen a fish around here? / Yeah. Short guy. A little confused. Keeps forgetting his name. / / Where is he? I should get him back to his bowl before he dries out. / Already taken care of.

Mr. Diablo, is it true that you are a chicken? / You... You are a lawyer. I have heard of your species. / / Although I admire your dedication to evil, your species is slow and stupid.

I will not eat green eggs and ham. / I will not eat them, Sam I am. / / I will not eat them on a boat. / I will not eat them with a ... a ... Hmm. / / Ooh. That's a tough one. / Moat? Croat? Bloat? Merlot? http://www.goats.com/archive/971006.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971007.html
I... I found a mouse in the sink. / I wonder how he got in there. / / / He looks vicious, watch out. He could attack at any moment. / Look at the size of those fangs. http://www.goats.com/archive/971007.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/971008.html
I don't think I can bring myself to kill the mouse in the sink. / What are we going to do? / / Maybe we can scare it away. / Oh yeah! You're good at that. Just pretend it's a woman. / / This situation is somewhat different. I'm not attracted to the mouse. / We could get some frilly lingerie for the mouse, and a beer for you. http://www.goats.com/archive/971008.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971009.html
Maybe if we yell at the mouse, it'll get scared and run away. / Sure. Give it a shot. / / You stupid mouse! You're so stupid! And your job is unfulfilling! And women loathe and avoid you! And even if you managed to get into a relationship, it would be with someone that played with your mind and hurt your self-esteem! / / That wasn't as much of a yell as it was an attempt to demoralize the mouse. / It wasn't really directed towards the mouse as much as it was directed towards yourself. http://www.goats.com/archive/971009.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971010.html
The mouse is still in the sink. / Persistent little vermin, ain't he? / / So what do we do now? / I have an idea. / / Phillip, you're brilliant. / You'd be surprised how many problems beer can solve. http://www.goats.com/archive/971010.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971011.html
You know, no matter how many of these we have, we're still going to have to deal with the mouse in our sink. / Yeah. / / Okay. I have an idea. We construct a large P.V.C. scaffolding over the sink. Then, we use the nylon straps from your backpack as a harness. We place the neighbor's cat in the harness, and lower it into the sink where it will eat the mouse. / / You're insane. / You're right. What if the cat is allergic to mice? I suppose we could apply an adhesive to it's stomach. http://www.goats.com/archive/971011.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971012.html
The mouse! It's gone. It's not in the sink anymore. / It couldn't have climbed out... it's too high. / / Maybe it just... vanished. Maybe it was a Jedi Mouse, and it's time had come. As it died, it's body simply disappeared, and it became one with the force. You know, like Yoda. / / Maybe it crawled down the drain. / Why, because you can't accept a mouse as a Jedi Knight? You... you mouse bigot. http://www.goats.com/archive/971012.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/971013.html
Pardon me, but is that the spirit of the mouse we found in our sink floating in mid-air? / / Yes, a mouse I was, but not just a mouse. For I was a Jedi Mouse. Now, I have passed on to the other side, and I have become one with the force. I have returned to guide you, to teach you the ways of the Force. / / Have you been spiking my beer with LSD again? / Not this week. http://www.goats.com/archive/971013.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971014.html
Okay, let's assume that you are indeed the spirit of a dead Jedi Master Mouse. Why have you returned? / / I have returned to guide your destiny. You must travel to the Dagobah system. There, you will meet Brooke Shields, the Jedi Master that instructed me. She will teach you in the ways of, you know, "gettin' it on." / / But... but why me? / The Force runs weakly in your family. You don't have it... your father doesn't have it... and your brother is almost constantly stoned. http://www.goats.com/archive/971014.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971015.html
Neil! I need a lift to the Dagobah system. / No can do, Jon. / / Bob is our pilot, and he's completely loaded. You'll have to wait until he sobers up. He's been running around the bar all night, claiming he's the "Lord of the Dance". / / Mambo or be vaporized, turtleneck boy. / Roger!

Bob, go run outside and warm up the spaceship. We're taking Jon to the Dagobah system. / / Is he okay to drive? He was pretty drunk. / Oh, no problem.

How was your trip to Dagobah? / We never went. / / After careful perusal of some star charts, we determined that Dagobah isn't real. It's only in the 'Star Wars' movies. You know, life is a lot like a movie. / / No it's not. If it was, it'd be over in 2 hours. / That still doesn't explain the Jedi Mouse.

Thanks for tuning in. / Blerg. Eat kitty. http://www.goats.com/archive/971028.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971029.html
YEEHA! / / This happens far too often to be mere coincidence. http://www.goats.com/archive/971029.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971030.html
Hold on... I can see Diablo's head. It hasn't been completely digested yet. / This is all Jon's fault. He never should have run away. / / I think I can pry it out. / Everyone knows that you don't run away from your problems. Unless, of course, you want your pets eaten by mutant eggplants. / / Ooh. I hope Diablo didn't need that half of his face. / If Jon had gone straight to the police, none of this would have ever happened. http://www.goats.com/archive/971030.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971101.html
Alright... Diablo needs to have his head reattached, and Jon is the only one who knows how to do it. But his note said that he had run away to join the circus. / / So, where do we go to find him? / / Ooh! Disneyworld! / Let's try this again. http://www.goats.com/archive/971101.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/971102.html
Hi... Can I help you? / Yes... I've come to apply for the 'Clown' position. / / Okay. Can you juggle? Have big feet? Fit into a small car? / No. No. No. / / Well, at least you won't need much makeup... Your face is laughable enough as it is. / Oh. That's reassuring. http://www.goats.com/archive/971102.html

Phillip was kidnapped by aliens yesterday. / Really. / / I wonder if he's okay. / I'm sure he's fine. He watches "X-Files" all the time. / / AAHHH!! you freaks keep that thing away from my butt. http://www.goats.com/archive/970827.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970828.html
You must be wondering why we brought you on our ship. / The thought had crossed my mind. / / We want to question you regarding your superior beverage storage technology. / Huh? / / That large protuberance from your midsection. / Oh, you mean the "Great White Beast". http://www.goats.com/archive/970828.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970830.html
The aliens that abducted Phillip still haven't returned him. / Really. / / I can't imagine what sort of adventures they must be having... travelling through the heavens, sharing the secrets of the universe with Phillip. An amazing cultural exchange. / / So after you've poked the hole in the base of the can, you pull the tab at the top and suck all the beer through the bottom. http://www.goats.com/archive/970830.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970831.html
Phillip! You've returned! / Yup. The aliens brought me back safe and sound. / / Because my name is unpronounceable in your language, Phillip has decided to name me 'Neil' / and I will be known as 'Bob'. / / You named them Neil and Bob? / It's better than 'Ben and Jerry'. / Out navigator is now known as 'Dances with Lemurs'. http://www.goats.com/archive/970831.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970901.html
Our new alien friends seem to have had one beer too many. / / Woo-Hoo! Yip yip yip! Lookit me, I'm a cowboy! / Whoa. Look at the orbs on that specimen. / / Great. They're wasted. You've corrupted yet another species. / I know. I'm so proud. http://www.goats.com/archive/970901.html

I wonder why more people don't wear clothing made of beef. / / Imagine it... Tasty strip steaks sewn together to produce comfortable suits, suitable for a range of activities from sports to office wear to formal wear. / / Stylish, yet affordable. I can see it now... no more need for laundry. and an increase of incidents of nudity at barbeques. http://www.goats.com/archive/970902.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970903.html
I've developed a way to create infinite amounts of beer. All we need is a supercollider, a handful of neutrinos and an eggplant. / That's it. I've had enough. / / For weeks now I've had to put up with your stupid eggplant jokes. Well, I'm not going to sit here and be treated like a second-class citizen. I am not an animal! / / I'll get the neutrinos, you get the parmesan. / I think we have breadcrumbs in the kitchen. / Hey! http://www.goats.com/archive/970903.html

I'm going to start a rock band. Chicks dig rock stars. / You can't start a band. / / Why not? / Well, for one thing, goats can't play instruments. You have no hands. / / So? Bon Jovi has no talent. And look at them. You think the Spice Girls play their own instruments? / The Spice Girls play music? http://www.goats.com/archive/970904.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970905.html
You're so smooth with the ladies, Toothgnip. What's your secret? / I told them I was starting a rock band. / / He's so dedicated to his art... and his horns are dreamy. / He's angst ridden and gruff, but in a cute way. / / So all I have to do is tell wome I'm in a band? / That implies that women will talk to you. http://www.goats.com/archive/970905.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970907.html
Women won't talk to me. / I know. That's because you're hideously ugly. / / However, I've fashioned this Iron Mask for you to wear which will shield women from your disfigured visage. / / So now they'll talk to me? / No. You're a dork. But it's funny to watch you pick up women in an Iron mask. http://www.goats.com/archive/970907.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/970908.html
My friends told me that if I wore this mask that women would talk to me. / They lied. You're a dork and you smell of rancid eggs. / / You know, I thought that if I wore this mask, I might meet someone who would look past the physical, and see me for the caring, sensitive person that I am. I know now that this will not come to pass. / / From now on, I face life openly and honestly. / My lord. For the love of god, put the mask back on. http://www.goats.com/archive/970908.html

A shame that Jon is missing out on all this tasty beverage. / He's not coming. He went to Connecticut to visit his friend Rich. / / Jon left the city? He'll never survive out there. / He'll be fine. It's not like you need wilderness training for the suburbs. / / Ooh! What's that? And that other thing? / Those are trees. And the bright fiery thing is the sun. http://www.goats.com/archive/970909.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970910.html
So what's the plan for tonight? / My friend 'Smooth' Howie G. is having a party. / / It's going to be huge... Smooth Howie said there's gonna be hundreds of single women. Maybe they'll even talk to you. / / No! No! I have no more self-respect left! / Calm Down. I have an iron mask you can borrow. http://www.goats.com/archive/970910.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970911.html
No. No more. / Hey, calm down. The party's gonna be a blast. / His nerves are shot. / / I'm telling you, all you need to make it easier to talk to the ladies is a little "liquid courage". Smooth Howie G. is gonna have three kegs of Busch Draft Lite. MM-MMM! / / I have a sense of impending doom. / It's okay... No women will probably talk to you anyway. / Busch! Busch! Busch! http://www.goats.com/archive/970911.html

Welcome home, Jon... How was your weekend in Connecticut? / Hee hee. / / I... I met a girl. Hee hee. She talked to me. / / What's wrong with him? is he posessed? / Nah. Probably a venereal disease. / The kind that turns you into a babbling idiot. / Yeah. http://www.goats.com/archive/970913.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/970915.html
She actually talked to you? / For almost fifteen minutes, can you believe it? / / We have so much in common. She likes food... I like food. She has hair... I have hair. It's like we were made for each other. / / So, the Iron Mask actually worked. / No, I wasn't wearing the mask. It was dark. http://www.goats.com/archive/970915.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970916.html
Cheryl? Hi... It's Jon. The one from the party... No, the one without the monkey. Listen, I was just calling to see if you'd like to have dinner sometime. / / Hmm. / / Exactly how much shampoo do you use in a week? http://www.goats.com/archive/970916.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970917.html
She said yes? / Jon actually called this girl. On the phone. They're having dinner this weekend. / / This is terrible news. Jon's constant misery is a great source of entertainment for me. I can make him cry in under five minutes these days. If he starts seeing someone, he might be happy. / / The date must be stopped... but how? / Ooh! Ooh! Ritual sacrifice! http://www.goats.com/archive/970917.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970918.html
I've come up with a plan of how we can ruin Jon's date and keep him depressed and easy to torment. / / When his date gets here, we all surround her. Then, we all rub up and down against her until she builds up a strong static charge. / / Then, I'll stick her to the ceiling like a balloon! / Women tend to shy away from you don't they? http://www.goats.com/archive/970918.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970920.html
Hey, It's Jon... just calling to confirm our date for tonight. I'm good... You? What do I do for a living? I'm... uh... I'm... / / I'm a computer geek... oh really? You find that arousing? Well... You know, I also play the accordion. / / She's moaning. / In horror, I assume. http://www.goats.com/archive/970920.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/970921.html
Aren't you supposed to be out on your big date tonight? / She cancelled. / / Something about an emergency business trip... but she promised to call when she gets back. She'll call. / / Sure. Sure she will. / Oh, beer. You'll never go on a business trip, will you? http://www.goats.com/archive/970921.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970922.html
Ooh! Cookies! / Yes, please have one. They're each shaped like a different 20th century president. / / I baked them myself. Soon, they will be sold in stores across the country. Children will eat them, and I will gain their trust and allegiance. Soon after, they will join my satanic cult. / / Mmm... look! I bit the head off Gerald Ford. / Make that "children and the feeble-minded." http://www.goats.com/archive/970922.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970923.html
Hi, jon. Have a cookie. I made them myself. / / Ooh! It looks like Millard Fillmore. / / Mmm... what a strange aftertaste. What's in these? / Mrs. Truman's first-grade class. http://www.goats.com/archive/970923.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970924.html
Diablo, This time you've gone a bit too far. / / I mean, yeah, sure, the whole satanic cult thing is cute, we all get a kick out of it, but you brutally slaughtered an entire class of first-grade children and baked them into tasty, yet morally ambiguous cookies. / / Why did you do it, Diablo? Why? / Well, I was going to use a troop of Girl Scouts, but I thought, 'nah, too cliched.' http://www.goats.com/archive/970924.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970925.html
Pardon me, sir, but we've had reports that someone at this address slaughtered a class of first-grade children and made them into cookies. / / You must mean Jon.

Did you bring the bail money? / Uh... Yeah. Hold on. / / Here it is. Sixty-three cents. Ooh! And my lucky bottlecap. / / Bail is set at $50,000. / I stopped at the bar on the way here. http://www.goats.com/archive/970928.html

In other news, alleged mass-murderer Jon Rosenberg goes to trial in two days. / / Rosenberg has been accused of brutally slaughtering a class of first grade children and their mascot, Fluffy the Hamster. He baked their remains into tasty, yet morally ambiguous cookies. Tonight, we talk to an aquaintance of this fiend, this "Marv Albert of Pastries". / / Thank you for appearing, sir. We have but one question: Why did he do it? / Satanic internet cults. http://www.goats.com/archive/970929.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970930.html
This is a perfect example of just how dangerous these satanic internet cults can be. First, kids are sending e-mail to lucifer, and before you know it, they're heating up trays of six-year olds at 450 for 15 minutes. / / And then these cult leaders avoid responsibility by hiding behind the veil of the First Amendment. I mean, look at this 'Pope' guy. He must be stopped. Unfettered speech and independent thought will be the downfall of traditional, non-electronic cults unless measures are taken now. / / So, you're in favor of government censorship? / Hell, no. That's my job. http://www.goats.com/archive/970930.html

Jon, I got you a lawyer for the trial... His name is Frank Coffee. / / He says he's never lost a case. / Well, maybe a few.

...So, by allowing the sale of human organs on the open market, we can increase the supply and actually save lives. / / Hmm. Toph, just exactly how much could one sell one's organs for? / Well, for example, a kidney would go for $250,000. / / Whoa. I'm gonna go sell my liver. Think of all the beer I'll be able to buy. / Sure. Maybe even an entire bottle. http://www.goats.com/archive/970716.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970720.html
So I haven't seen Jon around in a while. How's he doing? / / I'm not sure. Yesterday, I came home and found him on the floor, naked, clutching his computer and saying over and over, "You still love me, don't you, baby?" / / You lived with him in college... is that normal? / Sure, par for the course. Just throw him a candy bar. http://www.goats.com/archive/970720.html

Hello, everyone, and welcome to the Microsoft campus. I'll be your tour guide, Diablo / / Straight ahead, you'll see a complex that houses our main research labs.

My butt hurts. http://www.goats.com/archive/970806.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/970807.html
So why'dya sell out to Microsoft, Diablo? Was it the money? the chicks? / Ah, but you underestimate me, dear Toothgnip. / / It is I who will soon run Microsoft. With my new, powerful robotic body, I will soon take over. Gates has forseen this; he knows it to be true. Oh, and by the way, I'm your father. / / No... It's not true.

So what do you want? / You will come with me and rule the underworld as my demon bride. / / Look, I've had enough of you guys coming in here with your weird come-ons and your satanic rituals, so you can just take it outside. / / So go on get out of here. / Ah. You are as fiesty as you are beautiful. You will do nicely. http://www.goats.com/archive/970810.html

Toothgnip , you always seem to do well with females. Advise me on how to win the heart of a woman that spurns me. / Well, let's see... / / I often find it helpful to mentally abuse them, taunt them.

Please, continue. / If that doesn't work, make fun of her mother. http://www.goats.com/archive/970811.html

I think the key to meeting the right woman is to be honest. We all have an innate drive to search for a higher truth. / / As elusive as a well oiled lizard, yes. But I feel that truth is within our grasp. / What the hell are you babbling about? / / So after I defused the bomb, 6 swedish terrorists stormed the room, luckily I had my pocketknife. / Ooh!

Well, you didn't make out quite as well as you did last year. / Break it to me gently. / / You owe $35,000 / / Actually, your tax refund was $100, but my rates went up a tad. / What if I just give you my first born? http://www.goats.com/archive/970414.html

I don't get these commercials with the giant candies. / I like 'em. I wish I had a giant candy. / / If I had a giant candy I'd make a house out of it.

So a friend of mine has been drawing this comic strip, and he insists on basing a character on me. / / I wouldn't mind so much, but he draw badly. Make me look ugly. Not look like me. / / Agh, grr, argh / Well, it could be worse. http://www.goats.com/archive/970511.html

Out of all the modern ones, 'Alladin' is clearly the best. / Sorry, but I have to cast my vote for 'The Little Mermaid'. / / The only reason you say that is because you want to sleep with the mermaid. / So?

Due to 'Goats' declining popularity, we've decided to introduce a new character, one that a wider audience can relate to. / / Meet "Diablo" the chicken.

I don't like you. / I did sense some hostility coming from you / Like to discuss it? / / There's nothing to discuss. Before you showed up, I wath a lot of monkeys and fishes and stuff.

He's on his way / Who? OLIVER? / See?

See, I have an even better idea. You fly right the hell back where you came from. Or I'm going to reboot the universe. / POWER SWITCH / / You can't do that! We're running off of that laptop, too!

Back off, boys. He may be telling the truth about the laptop. I can't get a good read on him. / You wouldn't! You'd destroy yourself in the process! / / Wouldn't I? A suicide-prone fish with an unstable split personality? Let's think about this, fellas. / / But WHY?!

Just walk away. I will give you safe passage in the wasteland. Just walk away and there will be an end to the horror. / Wasteland? / What about our SINGULARITY? / / Tarfon, set portal coordinates to the current location of the spacecraft and open on a random destination, instant transport. / / ZOT! / / Where the HELL did you just send them? / Why? You planning on send out Christmas cards? They were a distraction, and we have business to attend to. http://www.goats.com/archive/051229.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060102.html
Give up the laptop little fish, or I'll transport you somewhere that smells even worse than it does here. / Oh, I doubt you could target quite that precisely. Do you really want to risk losing this? / / We both know that deep down you're too much of a goody two-shoes to pull the trigger on the entire universe. So why don't we stop playing this game? / / You're right, of course. In the end, I just don't have it in me.

You're just going to strand us in some backwater dimension with no way home? / You didn't seem to mind doing the same thing to Toothgnip. / / I'd rather you kill me now. / Lucky for you that your father feels differently. / / He's not my father. I have no father. / / Well, the action bits were pretty good, but my aorta is clogged from all the melodrama. / Shut up, Gus.

I am SO ashamed of myself. When did I become such a sappy, whiny sentimental bastard? / There's no time for recursive whining. We have WORK to do. / / WORK? Oh no. We're done here, and I'm going to the friggin' DISNEY DIMENSION. I'm gonna sit in the "Small World" ride for a few days and see how many brain cells I can kill off with the aid of some animatronic Dutch children. / / You do what you want.

Why do we always have to be ending the universe? Can't we just live in it, like normal people? / When I was connected to the laptop, I had administrator access to all of existence. / / The whole shebang is running on a custom operating system that those ancient Mayan programmers slapped together.

http://www.goats.com/archive/060111.html
So... how many years do we have left? / In a little less than seven years the whole of existence will simply boil away into nothingness. / / Oh. Because you made it sound kind of urgent. / I'd say this take precedence over most other concerns. / / We could still go to the Disney Dimension for a bit first. / No. / I have coupons! / I said NO. http://www.goats.com/archive/060111.html

Look, neither you nor I know enough about ancient Mayan programming techniques to do much good here. Let's let the experts take care of things and enjoy what little time we have left. / What experts? / / You have a point. Are there any unpaid interns nearby? Debugging the universe would be good experience. / We may not know how to fix things, but we know someone who might. / / You sure? 'Cause I can't think of anyone smart enough. / I didn't say he was SMART. / SAVE "monkeyworld",8 / / It's Hitchcock from before he died. / Non.

What are we doing back here?

How does this help us find Oliver? / / By returning here, we're trying to replicate the conditions under which we banished Oliver so we can wind up in the same place he and his flunkies went. / And if we fail to replicate the conditions exactly? / / Most likely we'll wind up in some random level of existence with no frame of reference to calculate a route home. / There is no amount of sarcasm that will allow me to adequately express just how terrible this plan is. http://www.goats.com/archive/060209.html

Look, you're just going to have to trust me on this one. It'll be a CAKEWALK. / Have you ever tried walking on cake? It's harder than it sounds. / / We pop in. We taunt Oliver until he inadvertently blabs the information we want. We go get Phillip, and we bring him back here to fix the code running on Woody's laptop. Simple. / You're an optimist! That's so cute. / Tarfon, activate transport. / / ZOT! / / / Gus, do me a favor and put this somewhere safe. / You got it, Boss http://www.goats.com/archive/060213.html

Oh. My. GOD. / I think this stench should be proof enought that God is dead. He'd never allow this. / / What is this place? What is this STUFF? / This is what it must feel like for Bill when he has to have sex with Hillary. / / It's like my lungs are filled with SLUGS. / It smells like a dog died inside of another dog. http://www.goats.com/archive/060214.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060215.html
Let's start making our way up towards those rocks. / Oh, brilliant idea. Let's just wade across a lake of foul-smelling mucus for no apparent reason. / / If Oliver ended up here that's probably the direction he would have went. / I don't think Oliver is here. / / How could you possibly know that? / Well, I can HOPE it, because if we exiled him HERE he's going to kill us on sight. / / Your hope is misplaced. If Oliver's not on this plane that means we miscalculated our trajectory, and we're somewhere off the grid with no reference points to guide us home. / Universal apocalypse is looking more and more like a sensible alternative. http://www.goats.com/archive/060215.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/060216.html
The stench isn't so bad up here. / I think the scale of relative badness is broken in this place. / / We'll stow the robot between these two pillars. I don't want Oliver getting anywhere near this thing. / Okay, Chairman Mao, where to now? We go on a long march to nowhere? / / No. / We follow these guys. / / This is EXACTLY why I won't eat French cuisine. / Quiet! http://www.goats.com/archive/060216.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060220.html
You want to follow a bunch of armed slugs? They smell worse than EUROPEANS. / They must have some sort of camp nearby. / / We'll shadow them, gather intelligence, and mount a six-month search campaign covering the most likely areas Oliver might have travelled to. / / Nuh-uh. I'm tired of taking orders, and there's no way I'm spending half a year here. I have a better idea. / / Hey guys! I know you're pretty busy hefting spears and sliding around in your own waste products, but could you spend like five minutes trying to invent personal hygiene? / / THAT was your better idea? / I got us a ride. http://www.goats.com/archive/060220.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060221.html
Oh, quit yer bitching. This isn't so bad. / / Name one redeeming quality of our current situation. / We can pretend we're salamis hanging in a delicatessen. / / I don't think we need to pretend that. / Dags-nabbit, now I got myself all hungry. / / Excuse me, slugs? Do you guys have anything to eat? / / You will be provided a last meal before your executions. / Do you like cupcakes? http://www.goats.com/archive/060221.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060222.html
How convenient! Slugs that speak english. / We speak the traveller's tongue only to cursed outsiders like yourselves. / Someone said something about CUPCAKES? / / Someone also said something about our EXECUTION. The cupcakes can wait. / I don't want to die on an empty stomach. / / These are the last of our cupcakes. / The rest were stolen by the Truhulu raiding parties and their outsider masters. OUTSIDERS LIKE YOU. / / May you slowly digest these cupcakes in the underworld as your souls burn for ten thousand years in the fire of the demon. / Yummy! / / You know, all we've seen since we got here are rocks and slime. What are these made from? / You don't really want to know. http://www.goats.com/archive/060222.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060223.html
Now that you have eaten your ceremonial cupcake we will stab you until you are dead. / Then we will engage in celebratory hermaphroditic mating, writhing over your corpses in a giant, slimy, orgiastic ball of spite. / At least we get to be dead for that. / / WAIT, please! Tell us about these raiders that have stolen all your food. Perhaps we can HELP. / / The TRUHULU and SNEDROFF clans have been enemies since the dawn of time, but there has been a D?TENTE for many years. / Until the OUTSIDERS came. / They are strange and bizarre aliens, HORRIBLE to behold. They locomote on sticks like your friend here does. / Two are giants, huge creatures that ride on the backs of Truhulu, wielding sticks and rocks and other weapons of mass destruction. / But they are nothing compared to their LEADER. He is small and yellow and issues forth a TERRIBLE STREAM OF PROFANITY. http://www.goats.com/archive/060223.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/060227.html
Sounds like Oliver hasn't wasted any time here. / Look, folks, we know that little yellow dude. We hate him just as much as you do, although I also love him as a son. I'm not embarrassed to admit that. / / I mean, c'mon, you're HERMAPHRODITES. Like a little SON-LOVING could ever compare to the embarrassment potential of having TWO DING-DONGS. / / Can I get something to drink? Thanks, Babe. Anyway, where were we? AH YES. The point is that we'd love to help you get a handle on your OUTSIDER PROBLEM, and we think we can do it for a lot less than the competition. / / So? What do you say? / We must discuss this amongst ourselves. Excuse me for one moment. / / Prepare yourself. We're going to have to FIGHT. / These guys? Nah. You watch, they totally bought it. / / If you help us get rid of the outsiders and return peace to our land, we will only stab you half as much as we were going to. / DEAL! http://www.goats.com/archive/060227.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060228.html
What do you mean, DEAL? Fifty percent fewer stabbings is still one hundred percent LETHAL. / You're pretty stupid for a cyborg genius-type. / / I just bought us a TON of time. If we hang in for a little longer the slugs will take us straight to Oliver. / / First, we goad them into battle with these other slugs they're not so keen about. In the ensuing chaos, we stuff Oliver in a Ziploc bag and hightail it out of there. / / It could work. What then? / Then I spank him on the patoot until he tells us where Phillip is. / SPANK him. / / What? That's not PERVY. I'm his DAD. I can spank him like a Mexican cleaning woman if I want to. / GIANT SPINNING MAGNETS won't erase that image from my mind. http://www.goats.com/archive/060228.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060301.html
I've got to admit, you've got a good plan there. / You're not the only ballerina at this recital, mister. / / What's your name, Sluggy Threeglance? / There are some who call me... FLEN. / Flen, we're going to need some things. / / Our resources are at your disposal. / First, I need a map of the village. It should include the routes the Truhulu raides take. / / I'm also going to need all your spear-crafters. / Yeah. Get those crafters out here STAT. / / And finally, I'm going to need TWENTY KILOGRAMS of WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM. / Is plutonium anything like a cupcake? / Well, it was worth a shot. http://www.goats.com/archive/060301.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060302.html
Well, things have certainly turned sunny-side up for us. / It's taking too long. / / You were the one planning a six-month recon mission just a while ago. / Based on the evidence so far, it's an extremely hostile universe. There's no way Phillip will last SIX DAYS out here. / / You're right. He's TOO STUPID TO LIVE. / By my calculations, he's probably been killed five times already. / SAVE "slimeworld",8 / / Come take a LAY in our HAY! It's the softest, most technologically advanced hay in all of the multiverse. / Thank you. / LOAD "topeka_prime",8,1 / / What in the name of the HOLY PORKMONSTER of PIGULON TWELVE is going on in here?! http://www.goats.com/archive/060302.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060306.html
FARMHAND BEAN! What're you doing inside the shrine? / / Daughter Farmella! I didn't know y'all were in here. I thought, what with all the ruckus, it might be a cow-snatcher or sumpthin'. Almost shot you with ol' Bessie here! / / You know well enough that no cow-snatcher could fit in here. / Who's this gray fella you got witcha? / / He's the PROGRAMMER. I've brought him back from the Pub Stub. / The Programmer? You SERIOUS?! Well, heck, and lookit me without mah autograph papers. / / Never mind that, Bean. Go tell the Farmer we've returned. She'll want to confab with the Programmer right-aways. / I don't got mah papers, but I do got a creamy innner thigh you could take a Sharpie to. / I think my libido has whiplash. http://www.goats.com/archive/060306.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/060307.html
I'm awful sorry about that. Farmhand Bean has forgotten his place. / / He will sleep with the cows tonight. / I'm sure he will. As for me, I could use a beer. I was told there was one of those Pub dealies on every level? / / You're standing where it used to be. The Axis Pub for Topeka Prime's level was razed many thousands of seasons ago. This is all that's left. / / Since that day all of Topeka Prime has been dry. / DRY? / / No ale will be brewed here until God's thirst for REVENGE is slaked with the BLOOD of the children of the destroyers of His holy Pub. / How about a lager, then? There could be some lager left in here maybe. http://www.goats.com/archive/060307.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060308.html
You've got to send me back to the Pub Stub. I'll come right back, I promise, just as soon as I figure out how to run copper tubing from there to here. / / There's no time for yer fancy indoor plumbin'. Every minute wasted is a minute we're closer to being deleted in THE BIG CRASH. The end of the universe is upon us! / / That's okay with me. There's bound to be drinks at a big event like tha... Oh. / / Come on. I'll take you to meet my ma. http://www.goats.com/archive/060308.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060309.html
You know, it may be a bit early for us to be introducing each other to our respective parents, seeing as we come from such different backgrounds. Also, I seem to recall now that I am MARRIED. YES! / / And I think it would be a BAD IDEA for me to be meeting anyone's mother SOBER. I can't even speak to my own mother on the phone without a healthy portion of single malt. / / Why do you fight your destiny, Programmer? It is GOD'S WILL that you are here. / You know, I met him once! Weird guy. Dressed like a PIRATE. / / Tasted pretty good though. http://www.goats.com/archive/060309.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060313.html
You went to the SHRINE? You know that travel outside the complex is FORBIDDEN during cow-snatcher season. / / I beg your pardon, Farmer, but I have brought THE PROGRAMMER. / Howdy. Nice farming dimension you've got here. / / Oh, impetuous youth. This was too soon. He ain't ripe. He could have aged for millenia in the Stub before ya fulfilled the prophecy. / I couldn't wait an extra minute, mother. I could not let him suffer an eternity in there, regardless of the consequences. / / You were thinking with your LOINS, Farmella. You have the brain of a goat in heat. Ah well. Let's see if we can't still make crap into CRAP-ADE. http://www.goats.com/archive/060313.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/060314.html
We can talk privately here. / I swear, Ma'am, there was no humping, bonking, banging or any other sort of daughter-porking going on. / / Oh, I know. Farmella is many things, but she would never abandon her people in their time of need, even if she does think she loves you. / LOVES ME? Lady, I met her half an hour ago. / / More than enough time for a nineteen-year old girl when she has been anticipating this meeting since her calving. But she has been practicing the knack for nineteen years as well. / You're making less sense than an epileptic auctioneer. / / I'll make it simple for your simple mind. If ya screw my daughter, she won't be able to travel between worlds no more. And if she can't do that, then we'll all die here in seven years time. Including YOU. http://www.goats.com/archive/060314.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/050816.html
So... what was out there? / Nothing. / / Do... do you want to talk about it? / NO. / / Thank God. 'Cause I'm not really equipped for empathy. Plus I don't like you that much. http://www.goats.com/archive/050816.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050817.html
Alfred, you say you've been here for nineteen thousand years, but you seem like a pretty contemporary guy. / Like I say, eet ees only been zat long subjectively. / / Eet was 1982 in Switzerland when I was first brought here. I remember because I had just started to despise Culture Club. / So that's twenty-three years, carry the one... / / And? / Well, the good news is that we have 244 days until last call. http://www.goats.com/archive/050817.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050818.html
You're saying that we're going to be stuck here for a year of subjective time before anyone notices we didn't come home? / That's about right. / / So even if someone realized we were missing, had the means to discover where we were, and mounted a rescue mission to steal Oliver's robot and come find us... / Decades, probably. / / We barely have enough to talk about to fill a single Thursday night. / Look on the bright side. Alfred said he'll let us run a tab. http://www.goats.com/archive/050818.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050822.html
So why does this aborted fetus of a universe just happen to look like our pub? / Ah, you Americans. Zo self-centered. / / Every single dimensional 'brane has an axis pub. You are not so special, you know. Zere needs to be something, yes? / / But why a pub? Why not a zoo? Or a lubricant factory? Or a ZOO FACTORY? / I see eet as further evidence zat God loves us, and wants us to be happy. http://www.goats.com/archive/050822.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050823.html
Zees thing you call ze internet... how does eet work now? / Well, I personally invented twelve percent of the internet, so I can tell you all about it. / / Fabulous! Other visitors have told me of zees wonder, but I have never gotten to see eet myself, being from 1982. / Well, you see, the internet is called "THE WEB". It's mostly powered by LASERS. / / Wow! / Primarily, we use the lasers to draw these things called "comics" directly onto the web. http://www.goats.com/archive/050823.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/050824.html
You know, it's weird. I've been trapped here for less than a day and panicking the whole time. / / Alfred? Nineteen millenia and he's still always got something to smile about. What's wrong with me? What's wrong that my perspective could be so utterly screwed up? / / CLICK / Maybe I can try and CHANGE my perspective. Maybe happiness isn't something that happens to you, but a CHOICE you make. / TIME! 31.8 years. A little slow there. http://www.goats.com/archive/050824.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050825.html
This is amazing! It's... it's as if a large weight has been lifted from my burdened shoulders, or as if a blindfold had been lifted from my eyes. Or an unwelcome gila monster removed from 'twixt my thighs. / / Wow. I feel like a hundred Mike Tysons! This is going to change EVERYTHING. / You stay the hell away from my ears. / / Lookee HERE, world! Watch me go. / Please do. http://www.goats.com/archive/050825.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050829.html
As happy as I am to see you find true bliss, it's made you more unbearable than ever. Science dictates that this sort of growth cannot go unchecked. / / I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to harsh your buzz. It's for you own safety. / Happiness is a choice, man. You say what you want. It's all kittens and sunshine for me. / / You're never going to see your girlfriend again. / Delightful kittens. Delightful, dessicated kitten corpses shrivelling in the sunshine. http://www.goats.com/archive/050829.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050830.html
Of course I'll see Megan again. Sure, it might take a few thousand years, but we'll be rescued! / Who do you know that's competant enough to stage a rescue? Jerrell? Neil? Diablo? / / / Maybe we'll die young. / Alfred! Twelve more scotches, neat. http://www.goats.com/archive/050830.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050831.html
Phillip, it's time like these, when a man is stuck in a midget dimension with no chance for escape, that he takes stock of his life. / / On reflection, I can easily say that all the mistakes I have made are, in some way or another, your fault. Every bad turn I've made, you've been at the helm, sowing chaos and stupidity through the landscape of my days like some sort of retarded Johnny Appleseed. / / CLINK / You're the worst possible friend a man could have. / I hate you too, buddy. I hate you too. http://www.goats.com/archive/050831.html

I completely forgot! My PSYCHIC POTATO! We can use it to call for help! / We're saved! / / Oh yeah. I gave the potato to Oliver a while back. Sorry. / We're doomed / That potato was almost out of juice anyway. / / That donkey puncher gave me a bum potato! http://www.goats.com/archive/050901.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050905.html
Freaking hippie long-hair. He'll get his. Man, my enemies list is getting unwieldy. / / That should keep the robot out of view while I get me a new goddamn potato. http://www.goats.com/archive/050905.html

cough cough / Goddamn, where did I pop into? The dusty redneck dimension? / / SCREECH! / Time to get proactive. TRAFFIC! STOP IN THE NAME OF OLIVER! / / You gentlemen will immediately escort me to the nearest potato-serving establishment. / I could go for a potato. / Fabulous, more carbs. You want to get chubby like Roger? / HEY! http://www.goats.com/archive/050906.html

Bob, I think I found them. / Yup. That's the singularity's energy signature. But what are they doing in Arkansas? / / Doesn't matter. But one of us is going to have to tell the goat. / I'm not going back there again. He's CREEPY. / / He's just a bit singed. Your closet shrine to Dakota Fanning, now THAT'S creepy. / I respect her as an artist. http://www.goats.com/archive/050907.html

Toothgnip? Hey there. Just came to see how you're doing. I brought CHEETOS! / You've found the eggling and the fish. / / Uh... yes. How'd you know? / Arkansas, eh? We're going after them.

I reckon we'll hit Missy's Diner before breakfast is over if we head out of here at first light. / And then that potato will be MINE! / You sure do like potatoes. / KHAN NOONIEN SINGH had no need for potatoes. There was no room for a potato in his clenched iron fist. You know, the fist that he ruled with. http://www.goats.com/archive/050912.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050913.html
So what's up with Khan Junior? Did he have a few too many Gary Busey moments out there on his bike? / Ah no way, man. It's his pops. / / He never knew who his old man was, see. And his mom never told him. / Best he can figger is that Ricardo Montalban was his father cause he found his photo in his Ma's wallet when he was stealin' out of it. / / He's seen Star Trek 2 about a hundred times now. / I can hear you, gentlemen. Genetically enhanced hearing and all that. http://www.goats.com/archive/050913.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050914.html
Screw this. Khan would never have sat around bullshitting by a campfire. He would have hijacked a starship and taken that diner out. / / We don't need to take out the entire diner, Junior. We just needs a potato. / Also, starships are fictional. / / Don't you sass me boy. I've FORGOTTEN more about starships than you'll ever know. / Did you forget how to brush your teeth too? Your mouth smells like a Corinthian leather factory. http://www.goats.com/archive/050914.html

I know it ain't none of my beeswax, but what do four rough-and-tumble boys like yourselves need with a potato anyhow? / / This potato is the first step in a much larger journey, Lucilla. Although they do not yet know it, my companions are about to accompany me on a quest to gain absolute control over the entire universe. / / While I applaud your entrepreneurial spirit, don't you think that's an ambitious thing to do with just a single potato? / You're RIGHT.

Oliver, we're going to take a short break while I drink a pot of coffee or two.

SQUISH RUMMAGE / People are just like robots, only smellier.

Without Oliver's cooperation, there isn't much we can do to find the singularity. / The robot's shielding makes it impossible to get a precise fix. / / Screw the singularity.

Feh. The matchbox is USELESS without the matches. / Looks like it's full. / / Impossible. I swear I saw Oliver take the matches out of the box. / Well, mister obviously-not-a-reliable-witness, I guess he missed a few, huh? / / We'd best be moving on from here before it gets dark. There are things in these hills more monstrous than the imagination can comprehend. / Also tonight is pudding night! http://www.goats.com/archive/051006.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051010.html
Does every alternate dimension have a pudding night? / Couldn't tell you. We're only assistant editors for Manhattan 3. / / We don't have access to make changes to any other levels. / How many levels are there? / / There's an infinite number of levels, and a team of assistant editors for each. / Which is why it's vitally important to get to pudding night as soon as possible. The lines get ridiculous. http://www.goats.com/archive/051010.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051011.html
I gotta tell you, we had to go through quite some trouble to get you here from Manhattan Three. / We got here ourselves last I checked. / / You didn't think a confluence of bizarre events like you guys have been going through just happens naturally, did you? / There was some meddling involved. / / MEDDLING? We've been through two separate incarnations of Hell. Aliens are chasing us. Half of New York is in FLAMES. / We're professionals. http://www.goats.com/archive/051011.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051012.html
So you guys are our... creators? / Oh, no. Assistant editors don't have permission to create anything larger than a potato, really. / / We don't create the universes. We just make tweaks, trim them here and there, keep things neat. Think of us as God's gardeners. / So there IS a God? / / Not like he's traditionally thought of on your level, what with the beard and the flowing robes and the good cop/bad cop routine. / He's only got a moustache. http://www.goats.com/archive/051012.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051013.html
You're not telling me that you two report directly to God, are you? / Oh no. Of course not. We've never even seen the guy. / / But the Editor-in-Chief takes meetings with him once a month. Apparently God keeps an interest in how things are going creation-wise, even though he's moved on to bigger projects. / / Bigger than creation? / All we've heard is that he spends a lot of time pretending to be a pirate named Larry. / It's very hush-hush. http://www.goats.com/archive/051013.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/051017.html
We spend a lot of our time writing business plans for various Manhattan 3 corporations. / The chief calls it "an effective method of affecting change." It gets pretty dry. / / So most of us editors have a few avocational writing projects going on as well, just for kicks. / And you guys... well, you're really fun to write for. / / I AM NOT A SITCOM CHARACTER! / No, no. Of course not. / But next week you're going to schedule two dates for the same night! Hilarity ensues. http://www.goats.com/archive/051017.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051018.html
Look, there's really nothing to get upset about here. / Your antics have become quite popular amongst our co-workers, actually. / / Well, of course they have. They're quality antics. / Which brings us to the reason we brought you here in the first place. / / You're the guests of honor at this week's pudding night. http://www.goats.com/archive/051018.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051019.html
Wait one second. Something's not right here. Why is Oliver's name up there on the banner? / Yeah, where is he? / Promises were made, Gus. / / Well, uh, see, he's going to be along later. He, uh, had to stop off to... uh... / HE HAD TO GO GET SPECIAL SURPRISE PRESENTS FOR EVERYONE! / / Yay! / Presents! / They went for the twist ending! I TOTALLY saw this coming. http://www.goats.com/archive/051019.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051020.html
You made a mistake. You were trying to write all three of us here but you screwed up somehow. / Please, keep your voice down. / / You weren't expecting Oliver to turn on us and bolt. Why is that? After all, you created him, didn't you? / Like I said, we're just assistant editors. / Hold yer horses, fellas. I created Oliver. / / This has gotten beyond your control. Take me to your editor-in-chief. http://www.goats.com/archive/051020.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051024.html
Okay, enough already with the ruckus over here. It sounds like mongoose mating season. / Chief, these are the folks I told you about. The ones from those stories we do on the side for kicks? / / I never gave you approval for that, you know. / They want to speak with you. We, uh... we may have made a few minor mistakes. / / Excuse me, are you... are you HIM? / Of course. Who else would take such a thankless job? Rob Reiner? http://www.goats.com/archive/051024.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/051025.html
I don't believe it. Woody Freaking Allen is the Editor-in-Chief of all existence. / Is it really so hard to believe? / / Well, you know. / "Hollywood Ending". / That was a DECOY! A ruse to throw people off my trail. It's not polite to appear too omniscent. / / Really? / No. I was distracted by Tea Leoni's ass. http://www.goats.com/archive/051025.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051026.html
Let's sit. We'll have some coffee and a nosh. I'm sorry about the rocks for chairs. We're getting some Ikea stuff delivered on Friday. / / Let me get right to the heart of the matter, Mr. Allen. In an effort to entertain their buddies around the watercooler, your employees here have written into existence a tiny dynamo of evil named Oliver. He has the knowledge, the tools and the desire to do widespread damage to the very fabric of the multiverse. / / I blame the monkeys for my poor parenting skills. / This is what I get for hiring sitcom writers. http://www.goats.com/archive/051026.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051027.html
This is all your fault! You wanted to spice things up with a new character! I said no, that's horribly cliched, that's Scrappy Doo all over again, but did you listen? / / I had to do something to bring the audience back after you drove them off with your ridiculous "Shazam Twix" ramblings. / I wouldn't expect an Apex Tech alumnus like yourself to understand the poetry of Shazam Twix. / / Besides, it's not like anything we do is out of line with the big guy's plan. As long as we're being fact-checked by an omniscient god, we're pretty much just doing his will, right? / See, about that... http://www.goats.com/archive/051027.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051031.html
Let me tell you a story. One day God comes to me and says that he's going be working on a new project, and that he's going to be incommunicado for a bit. / / I never did find out what he was working on aside from the fact that it involved dressing like pirates. He works in mysterious ways, you know. / / Anyway, he was working in mysterious ways from home when he was visited by two people who, I can't believe I'm saying this, tricked him into becoming a pork chop and then ate him. / So. God is dead. / Nietzsche was right! http://www.goats.com/archive/051031.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051101.html
I never did find out who the two hoodlums were. / This doesn't make any sense! God is omniscient! How could he possibly be so stupid as to allow himself to be eaten? / / Well, between you and me, God's not really that bright a bulb. I mean, the guy can build worlds, sure, but that's basically a construction job, very blue collar. / / Look at the Earth. Does it strike you as the product of an intelligent designer? / No, not really. / What's up with porcupines? http://www.goats.com/archive/051101.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/051102.html
Ever since God bit the big one, I've been trying to keep the whole thing quiet. It'd be bad for morale if it got out. / This is crazy, Chief. You can't cover up the murder of God. / / Maybe not forever, but I was hoping to make it past the holiday season. Things are already stressful enough this time of year. / The entire multiverse will colapse without divine guidance! / We'll cease to exist! / / My Don Knotts memorabilia will be worthless. / Don't get yourself in a huff. I've got the whole shebang running just fine on this new fancy laptop computer. http://www.goats.com/archive/051102.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051103.html
We may have been a mote in God's eye before, but now we're running on this baby. The stock markets of seventeen different versions of Earth are tied directly to my high score in minesweeper. / / You're running the infinite multidimensional whole of existence on a notebook computer? / I outsourced the whole thing to this very nice red fellow with a team of a dozen dead ancient Mayan programmers. / / Then Oliver must be in there somewhere. I'm going to need you to JACK ME ON TO THE MULTIVERSE. / Look mister, I don't know what you've read about me, but I don't do that sort of thing with animals. http://www.goats.com/archive/051103.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051108.html
What tipped you off that the monkeys created Oliver? / Just a hunch. No one that cliched could exist in real life. / / I thought they said they couldn't actually create anything, though. / Nothing bigger than a potato. Oliver is three percent smaller by volume than your average Idaho tater. / / If I'm not really Oliver's father we're going to have to reconsider his allowance. / Reconsider it to ZERO. I may have to kill him. http://www.goats.com/archive/051108.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051109.html
Look, I may only be Oliver's father by proxy, but I don't want to see him MURDERED. Not by someone else, anyway. / It's the only way. / / The assistant editors juiced up Oliver with unnatural levels of ambition and technical expertise in their pursuit to create a sort of compelling real-life third-season cast replacement. But they went too far. / / Now they've lost control of their creation, and their precious God isn't alive to fix their mistakes for them. There's a power void, and nature abhors a vaccuum. It's only a matter of time before Oliver makes his way back here. We have to bring the war to him first. http://www.goats.com/archive/051109.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/051110.html
I don't understand why I can't delete this Oliver person. The red gentleman said his programmers built triple error checking into their software thingies. / / I told you to hire my cousin, but NO, you had to outsource everything to the Mayan underworld. / Their rates were ten percent cheaper. / / Way to buck the stereotype, Woody. / This from someone who enjoys fleas as an appetizer. / Let's dispense with the petty banter, gentlemen. It's time to JACK ON. http://www.goats.com/archive/051110.html

Hello to regular readers of Goats. Today's strip is more for GUEST STRIP AUTHORS. / My name is Diablo Chicken. You may be familiar with me. I'm the SAFE HOOK character. / / The safe hook character is the one guest artists will use most in THEIR strips, because they're well-known, and have a clear personality. It's hard to do a SUBTLE strip regular readers will enjoy, so why not try to HIT ONE OUT OF THE PARK using a BELOVED MASCOT? / / So guest artists -- REMEMBER THE SAFE HOOK!

Alfred, if we're stuck in a void and you've been here for nineteen thousand years, how is the bar still stocked? / More importantly, how many Macallans before we run out? / / That eez an excellent question. By some way I don't understand, ze liquor is replenished when no one eez looking! I may not know how zees eez possible, but I have a few theories. / / There eez also ze possibility of a number of miniscule wormholes, each opening for a moment in ze distilleries of ze worlds and terminating here, siphoning off molecules of fine whiskey at a time. But zere has been no convincing evidence that stable wormholes can exist, and zis does not explain ze new bottles. / / Zere is also ze direct divine intervention! Many theologians reject zis argument, as God hasn't manifested in ze observable universe zo far, and zis eez a bit of a cop out for him. / / Or perhaps ze alcohol eez actually a fast-reproducing organism, 'owever, an extrordinarily shy one. Zere remains ze question of how zis organism would take in nutrients. Eet may be related to ze regenerating bar nuts. / / Or maybe our Stub Pub eez a Schroeninger's box of liquor, materializing it when observed... / / Have you noticed that talking to this guy is like watching Wikipedia have sex with a sommelier? / That gives me a great idea for a business. http://www.goats.com/archive/051118.html

Mister Toothgnip, why do I feel sad sometimes for no reason? / Usually it's because there's a space wizard battle nearby. / / Space wizards? / They're from space. And they like to fight a lot. Space wizard energy permeates the sadness centres of the brain and stimulates the production of sadness ions. / / My brain is always causing all sorts of trouble. / Space wizards are also responsible for five distinct types of indigestion. http://www.goats.com/archive/041129.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/041130.html
We have to find the space wizards and make them stop putting sadness lions in my brain. / Sorry, I can't help you there, kiddo. / / Why not? / It's that damned Prime Directive again. You know how it is. But I can point you in the right direction. / / You can? / Space wizards like to hang out at the MANHOLE, over in the meatpacking district. http://www.goats.com/archive/041130.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/041201.html
And where are you off to, little fish? / Im going to fight the space wizards! / At the MANHOLE. / / That's excellent. I tip my imaginary hat to you, good sir. / My hat is real! / Ask him about the outfit. / / He looks like a tiny Marlon Brando. / These are my wizard fighting clothes! / Bist du rumble-fertig? http://www.goats.com/archive/041201.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/041202.html
I can't believe you just sent fish off to the Manhole all by himself. / Oh, c'mon. He'll be fine. / / I don't care either way. I just thought you had a moral threshold. / I do. I like to keep it at home, in a drawer, where it's not so cumbersome. / / I am here to rumble with space wizards. / Rumbling's on Tuesdays, sweetie. Thursday is pot luck night! http://www.goats.com/archive/041202.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/041206.html
You wait here. I'll go get you some meatloaf and green beans. / Okay, mister space wizard! / / Mister Bruce the Sleestak? Is that you? / Oh! Fish! Uh... Hi there. Well, this is certainly awkward. / / I didn't know you were a space wizard! / I haven't heard that one before, but, I suppose I've been called worse. http://www.goats.com/archive/041206.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/041207.html
...so then Toothgnip told me I should come here and do battle. / Fish, you're not being tortured by space wizards. / / I'm not? / No. It sounds to me like maybe you're a little depressed. / / Depressed? That makes me so angry! / You're going to have to quit having new emotions until after we figure out the current one. http://www.goats.com/archive/041207.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/041208.html
You're right. I'm depressed. Depressed because I am still in love with REESE WITHERSPOON. A love that can never be. / / And yet, somewhere inside of my body, I still hold a small beacon of hope. Despite the odds, some part of me still feels like a small fish and a big Hollywood actress might somehow be able to make it work in this crazy world. / / Do you know how that feels? To feel that... that feeling inside of you all the time? / Not since Sex and the City went off the air. http://www.goats.com/archive/041208.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/041209.html
So what should I do to get rid of all this depression? / I say take decisive action. Follow your heart. / / Really? / To hell with what polite society says. Me? My fate is governed by one rule only: Live to regret nothing. / / Maybe a fish and an actor lady really can be in love. / Honey, if Holly and Chaka were able to put three very hairy children through college, then anything is possible. http://www.goats.com/archive/041209.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/041213.html
Well, I'm off to Hollywood to pledge my undying love to Reese! / Vaya con Dios, my phallic-faced friend. / / / You can come out now. / Is he gone? http://www.goats.com/archive/041213.html

http://www.goats.com/archive/041220.html
First, go left at the hot dog store. Then, go straight for three miles. You'll pass two ogres and a troll. Make another left at the troll. / Okay. / / That turns right into the parking lot for the giant castle where all the Hollywood stars live. The castle guard is a tiny pink man with perfect hair. You'll need to use this special poking stick to drive him into the moat so you can pass. / / Then, make your way past the lasers to the third floor... Are you getting all this? / How do you spell 'hot dog'? http://www.goats.com/archive/041220.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/041221.html
I wouldn't do this for just anyone, you understand. It goes against regulations. / I'm sorry. / / But your woeful tale of unreqiuted love touched me in a place I had long assumed to be dead. A dry, dessicated husk of mummified dryness. Maybe with some desert voles or something scampering about. / / Morning, Leonard. / Morning, Steve. http://www.goats.com/archive/041221.html

You that same Fish that's been sending me so many freaky-deaky love letters that my zip code got all worn out? / / Yes, that was me! I brought you a stamp so you could write me back next time. / / Well that's all dandy, but you better get yourself off my property before I get Ryan out here to whup your tiny ass into a salty paste. http://www.goats.com/archive/041223.html

Reese, something is not right! You weren't this mean last time I saw you! / Hon, I've never met you before in my life. / / You weren't smoking last time. I have heard that smoking can be bad for you! Maybe it's making you mean. / / Where is it exactly that you think this alleged meeting took place? / In the crazy red room in my mind. http://www.goats.com/archive/041227.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/041228.html
Listen, hon, none of that stuff ever really happened. It was just in your imagination. / But it seemed so real! / / Well, you need to start to learn how to differentiate real life from whatever it is that goes on in your head. There was no red room, no Robert Goulet. We've never met, and whatever you think there is between us is a fiction as well. / Maybe. / / Except for just one thing...

Ah hell. / / BZZZT / Ok boys, shut it down. We'll try Plan B. / / This helmet doesn't breathe at all. / We can try the brainstem tap again. / Nah, this is fine. http://www.goats.com/archive/041229.html

Pardon me, mister, but who the DAMN HECK HELL are you? / Am I to understand that you don't recognize your good friend and benefactor Gregor Mendel? After all, if it wasn't for me, you'd be food for worms instead of the other way around. / / One could say that you literally owe me your very life. And we scholars of genetics don't have much use for the concept of altruism. / Well, it's time to collect on that little favor I did for you. I need you to run some ERRANDS. / / Ironically, it's the very serum I created to resurrect you that made the use of all this gadgetry possible. A normal, mortal mind would never been able to withstand the strain of memory extraction and reconstruction. / / And I was so looking forward to breaking you. Remaking you in my own image. Into my own deadly right hand. / A shame, really. We had barely just begun! / / Of course, this just means we'll have to take the more... DIRECT route. http://www.goats.com/archive/041230.html

I don't know why they call them nuggets. It's an ill-fitting word. Poop comes in nuggets. / What would you call them? / / / Breasticles. / Oh, that's appetizing. http://www.goats.com/archive/050103.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050104.html
Guys, you would NOT believe who I just ran into outside. / Tony Curtis. / / No, not Tony Curtis. Why would you even say Tony Curtis? / Why wouldn't I? / I thought Tony Curtis was dead. / / No, he's alive. / He owns a bakery! / Every minute I am exposed to you two is draining five minutes of intelligence out of my brain. http://www.goats.com/archive/050104.html

I just saw the Buddha outside! On the road! / Sid Gautama himself? Oh, dude, you're totally screwed. / You know what they say. / / Why are they always saying things all the time?! / "If you meet the Buddha on the road, you must kill him." / / See? They always have to mess up a good idea with some fruity saying. / As if you needed an excuse to kill the Buddha. http://www.goats.com/archive/050105.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/050106.html
You know it's just a saying. / I'm well aware. / / So that means you don't need to take it literally. It's meant to be interpreted, like a zen koan. The Buddha represents an internalized or externalized ideal that we have to overlook in an effort to find the true self. / / But, of course, I suppose I'm just wasting my breath now. / Be a dear and go fetch my fuzzy dice. http://www.goats.com/archive/050106.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/020821.html
Have you ever thought about it? / No. I mean, of course I've thought about it, but I would never do it. / / It feels good. You should try it. I won't tell anyone. / Someone could be watching. / / Like who? / Leprechauns. From the FUTURE. http://www.goats.com/archive/020821.html

Hey, Phillip? / Yeah? / / You remember that time the Earth was destroyed? / Strange... I feel like I've had this conversation before. / / Deja vu? / No thanks. It makes me itchy. http://www.goats.com/archive/020823.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020826.html
It finally came! I've been invited to join the international league of pedants! / / The what? / The league is a secret organization dedicated to furthering the triumph of accuracy and correctness over tact. / / If it's so secret, why haven't I heard of it? / I can't believe you just asked me that. http://www.goats.com/archive/020826.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020828.html
So when is my invitation coming? / I don't think you're quite pedant material. / / Fine, then. I'll just start... a band or something. My new band's name will be "The Painful Erections". / Have fun with your little band. / / Run along, you socra-tease! You run off with your know-it-all friends! You'll be sorry! Before long, record producers will be begging for "The Painful Erections"! http://www.goats.com/archive/020828.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020830.html
I.L.O.P. Secret H.Q. / I'm here for the league meeting. / What's the secret rap? / / I'm pale as formica, social skills stunted small. But I'm accurate like a pica, I know the capital of nepal. I'm the nemesis of error, dreadful diction fears my skills, more inquisitive than Jim Lehrer, snottier than Beverly Hills. / / I.L.O.P. Secret H.Q. / Word to your biological mother. / You mispronounced "formica". http://www.goats.com/archive/020830.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/020902.html
It's a pleasure to have you here at the league, Phillip. We're very excited. I'm Mark Rogaski, this chapter's treasurer. / / This is Lawrence, our secretary of snacks. He can show you where the Cheez Doodles are. / I'm going to be a Mentat when I grow up. / / Do you have any beer, Lawrence? / Beer is not a snack. http://www.goats.com/archive/020902.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020904.html
So is this one of the smaller League Chapters? / This is the only chapter. / / I thought this was an International Organization. / Well, there's one guy who teleconferences in from Guam. / / I thought Guam was a U.S. territory. / Quiet, you fool! That's how the "Great Guam Fracas" of '97 began. / A fracas! A fracas!! http://www.goats.com/archive/020904.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020906.html
And now, please rise as we welcome the exalted Poobah of Pedantry, our lawfully-elected Leader of Loquaciousness, our... / That's plenty, Lawrence. / / Here's Ken! / Before we begin, I'd just like to take a moment to point out how spiffy my new cape is. / / Why are you wearing a cape, and how can you justify the expense? / The answer to both those questions is "I look smooth." http://www.goats.com/archive/020906.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020909.html
3 hours later... / ... yes, I think that we've fully established that Jesus Christ was, in fact, in favor of potatoes. He was pro-potatist. Can we move on to the next item on the list? / / I have a question. Why are they called stereotypes if they exemplify a single trait? / Who are you, Steven Wright? / / At least I'm not the one that wanted to induct Worf into the league. / Who doesn't like Worf? http://www.goats.com/archive/020909.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020911.html
3 more hours later.... / The other day, I heard about this woman, she was eating a hot dog and it had mustard on it, and her uterus fell out. / / *snap* / Just like that. / / You don't have any friends, do you? / No. But if I did, it'd probably be Optimus Prime. http://www.goats.com/archive/020911.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/020913.html
Folks, I'm really enjoying this scintillating discussion, but is this all the league does? Why, exactly, are we here? / 42! / / This is pretty much it. And, occasionally, we do battle with our nemesis, the evil archvillain Staropramen. / Bwahaha! / / Staropramen! You old dog, what are you doing here? / You mind if I use your bathroom? I had a burrito for lunch, and it's checking out early. http://www.goats.com/archive/020913.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020916.html
Who's this Staropramen guy? / He's just your standard eastern-European Cold War-era super-villain. You've never heard of Staropramen and Kommunist Kat? / / Kommunist Kat? / His sidekick. Kat's a 20-year old "boy" that Staropramen took in as his ward and dressed in a spandex cat outfit. / / Ew. / I only pray that we can win this Kold War. Or we'll all be dressing in spandex some day. http://www.goats.com/archive/020916.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020918.html
Thanks for the use of your facilities, Ken. You rock. / No problem, Staropramen. / / Oh, and you may not want to go in there for a while... I think I may have backed up your toilet. Badly. / / BWAHAHA / BWAHAHA / BWAHAHA / BWAHAHA http://www.goats.com/archive/020918.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020920.html
Oh that's just wrong. No one go back there. It's seeping into the main room. / I lost my shoes. / Okay, everyone, evacuate the building. / / I'll go call a plumber. / Forget the plumber. We need an exorcist. http://www.goats.com/archive/020920.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020923.html
Looks like someone ruined your pedants meeting by paying their nemesis to drive everyone into the street using only the sheer force of his bowels. / Why did you do this? / / It wasn't me. / I saw you! Giving money to Staropramen! With my eyes! / / It was Hitler. Hitler did it. / Now don't you go trying to make Hitler out to be a bad guy. http://www.goats.com/archive/020923.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/020925.html
Are you mad? / Yes. / / Mad as in the heart-warmingly funny sitcom "Mad About You"? / No. / / Helen Hunt is taking her Oscar way too seriously, if you ask me. / I don't believe I did. http://www.goats.com/archive/020925.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020927.html
I believe this is your chicken. / / / I didn't do it. / You're so full of it, even the Stool Fairy doesn't have enough quarters for all your crap. http://www.goats.com/archive/020927.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020930.html
...and through sophisticated poop-related scheming, revenge was finally mine. / Where did you meet this Staropramen fellow, anyway? / / He plays poker with Satan and I. He's a very efficient pooper. / Really... I think I'd like to meet these friends of yours. / / Sure thing. But Satan isn't nearly as efficient at pooping, you know. / I promise not to be too disappointed. http://www.goats.com/archive/020930.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/021002.html
It's this next building here on the right. / Satan lives in a walk-up on the Upper East Side? / / He's settled down a lot since we first met. / Satan is a yuppie. It all makes sense now. / / Can you reach the buzzer for me? / Sure, just hold onto the coffee cake. http://www.goats.com/archive/021002.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/021004.html
And stop slouching, for Pete's sake. You're meeting the Prince of Darkness and you're slouching. / Will you stop nagging? / / Ah, Diablo! You're early! And I see you've brought a friend. / / Hello My Name Is Stan / It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, come in. http://www.goats.com/archive/021004.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/021007.html
Well, I just got off the phone with Staropramen, and it looks like he and Kommunist Kat aren't going to be able to make it tonight. / / You two are more than welcome to stay, of course. Help yourself to some Diet Pepsi. I'll be right back with the hummus and crudites. / / And you worship this guy? / His hummus is amazing. http://www.goats.com/archive/021007.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/021009.html
Can I ask you a somewhat strange, personal question? / You want to know if I'm Satan. / / In a nut-shell. / Let me ask you a question. Would Satan make an onion dip this good? / / Actually, he might. This is freakin' delicious. / Okay, bad example. http://www.goats.com/archive/021009.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/021011.html
So if you're not Satan, what's Diablo been going on about for the last six years? / He misread my nametag. / / For six years? / Chickens have beady eyes. / / And you just forgot to correct him, I'm sure. / He was having so much fun. I didn't have the heart. http://www.goats.com/archive/021011.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/021014.html
Do you have any idea what chaos your little lie of omission has wrought? The things Diablo has done in your name? Evil, evil things. / / Hatred spread. War mongered. Morally ambiguous cookies. L.S.D.-tainted squirrels running through the park quoting John Irving novels. The proliferation of sweaters on little dogs. Unending despair. / / My god, the damage to my social life alone in incalculable. I could go on for days. / Yes, Diablo mentioned that about you. http://www.goats.com/archive/021014.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/021016.html
I suppose you'd like me not to say anything to Diablo so his feelings won't be hurt. / He calls me "Uncle", you know. / / Fine. Why do you wear a nametag, anyway? / So people know my name. / / You have all the answers, don't you? / Chicks dig the nametag. http://www.goats.com/archive/021016.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/021018.html
Diablo, why do you like this guy so much? / Dunno. I guess it's because he accepts me despite my differences. He's the father I've never had. / / I think I can understand that. / Plus I won forty grand off him this year alone. He had to sell his Camaro. / / That's terrible. / Hell, that's nothing. He lost his dead mother's panties to Staropramen last week. http://www.goats.com/archive/021018.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/021021.html
Sorry to have disturbed you, Mr. "Satan". We should be going now. / No trouble at all. It was a pleasure having you. / / Bye now. http://www.goats.com/archive/021021.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/021023.html
I need to attract mates at a more frenzied rate. / You'll need a more desirable groinal area, then. / / An excellent idea! I will decorate my manpiece with doodads and shiny bits. No living creature will be able to resist the allure of my highly adorned snack pack. / / Where does one go for a well-accessorized crotch? / I hear Bloomie's is having a sale on tea towels. http://www.goats.com/archive/021023.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/021025.html
Codpieces / $12.95 / I need a larger codpiece. This one isn't threatening enough. / You could use a real cod. / / A real cod isn't intimidating. I want my schlong to induce panic as I roam the countryside. / Cods have all those tiny pointy teeth. / / No one's nipples harden at the sight of a man with a fish strapped to his package. It lacks pizazz. / You could glue some colorful glitter to the cod. http://www.goats.com/archive/021025.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/021028.html
I'm not convinced. / Just pass me the earrings. And the lipstick. Excellent / / / I'm not putting that anywhere near my genetals. / I'm gonna name him Maurice, would you like some tea? http://www.goats.com/archive/021028.html

C'mon! the seaon finale of "Tiny Dog Surprise" is starting. / So turn it on already. / / desecrators stock photo / Attention Earth people: You have exactly one hour to turn over the desecrators, or we will take over France.

http://www.goats.com/archive/020701.html
That man had a butt on his head. / Wait a second... Why were Neil and Bob's photos on that show? / / Oh my god come quick there's a giant spaceship over the bar and there are creatures coming out of it and they're not nearly as cute as the one from that Spielberg flick I... / / He had a butt on his head, Jon. / It's at times like these that I'm not sure if I did too many drugs in college, or not enough. http://www.goats.com/archive/020701.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020703.html
We have come for the desecrators. Our sensors have detected that they were here recently. / Do you guys come from... Uranus? / *snort* / / No, we come from a small world called... excuse me? Are you even listening? / I'm sorry. My friend is making an ass of himself. What planet is it? / / We come from the planet "Rectum". / >Giggle< / *Snicker* http://www.goats.com/archive/020703.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020705.html
I do not think you humans are taking this as seriously as you should! The fate of the French rests in your hands. We Rectoids have been searching for the two criminals you call Neil and Bob for many of your "Earth Years". / / They have desecrated the sanctity of our great exalted leader. / How so? / / They placed a small fur-bearing creature into his forehead crevice while he was sleeping. / Sounds like he was the butt of their joke. http://www.goats.com/archive/020705.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/020708.html
We know the desecrators are on this planet. We saw them on one of your television broadcasts. Now, you will tell me where they are. / No. / No. / / Please? / No. / No. / / Why not? / Because you are a stinky butthead. / Stinky butthead. http://www.goats.com/archive/020708.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020710.html
I have had enough of this insubordination. We will teach the humans the meaning of respect. Subcommander, go take over France. / Yessir. / / / You're back? / The French didn't seem to mind the invasion, sir. / But they keep asking for welfare and more vacation time. http://www.goats.com/archive/020710.html

So I'm also depressed about... / We're not listening to you Jon, due to the fact Philip and I suffer from "A.D.O." Ba-Gok! / "Attention Deficit Order".

Shortly before the destruction of Earth... / ...And then we called him a stinky butthead! / Ha ha! That's quite droll! / Well, I hope they have fun in France. It's definitely more their speed. / They'll certainly fit in scent-wise... / / BAMF!! / I am Thor, God of Thunder! / I've come to retrieve my goat. Come, Toothgnip! / / You see, the aliens are about to destroy Earth, and I couldn't bear to leave him with you. / Enjoy your remaining moments. Ta ta! / It's been real guys! / / Well, that was weird. / Excellent! If it's the end of the world, my lord satan should be along to retrieve me any moment now! / Strphanie, you spike the beer with acid again? / / I said...my lord satan...should be along...to retrieve me...any moment now! / Any...moment...now! / / / Well, there's one age-old philosophical question answered. / How embarassing. / Maybe time to switch sides, huh Diablo? Judgement day, and all that? / / Do you think Thor was serious about the aliens destroying Earth? / Nah...but hey, I think I'll go home and use that line to see if it turns Megan into a wild shag-monster! http://www.goats.com/archive/020716.html

Jon, Oliver is missing. / Missing? / / yo chicken guy, / I am off into the world to find fortune and glory. / you suck, / -Oliver / / Less than a week old? Really? / Shut your mouth and strap on your leather nose, maggot. http://www.goats.com/archive/040105.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040107.html
So where did Oliver go? / Dunno. I suppose we should try to find him. Right? / / Yeah, I guess. / I'll make some superpretzels. Something tells me we'll be needing them. / / Do you want to see the cuddle room, Oliver? / I've got Rupert Murdoch on hold and Bubbles in a gasoline-soaked trunk. Get your wallet out. / ook ook http://www.goats.com/archive/040107.html

And just where have you been all day? / Extorting money from Michael Jackson to fund the construction of an unstoppable homicidal robot. / / I don't remember giving you permission to do that. / I don't need your permission. You're just a jealous old man who sees the dim reflection of his failed youth in the shiny metal surface of my glorious reign of evil. / / I won't have you talking back to me. You are grounded young man. / You never let me do anything fun! I hate you! http://www.goats.com/archive/040109.html

I just can't seem to connect with Oliver. We have nothing in common / Strong relationships are built from the timber of shared experience. Is there some activity the two of you can do together? / / He likes to make unstoppable homicidal robots. / In many ways, his act of creation mirrors your own in creating Oliver. Perhaps you have more in common than you think. / / So you're saying that the robot is... my grandson. / Sure. Why not. http://www.goats.com/archive/040114.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040116.html
So. Makin' a robot, I see. / This kit sucks. I can't get the quantum annihilators aligned properly. / / Did it come with a willie? / Ugh. Dad, no it did not come with a willie. / / Because in my day, we didn't have kits. We made them ourselves, out of empty coffee cans and VIC-20 motherboards. And each and every one of those robots sported a twelve-inch steel johnson. / Talking to you is an intensely damaging experience. http://www.goats.com/archive/040116.html

Oliver, when a chicken sees his offspring creating a murderous automaton, it brings to mind his own most cherished and repressed childhood memories. As such, I feel as though I should share with you a tale from my own childhood that might help us understand one another. / Fine. Give me some chocolate. / / I just so happen to have brought some Chilean chocolate with me in an effort to placate you. / This... This is delicious! I've never heard of this Chilean chocolate before. / / It is made from the hearts of toddlers. / Toddler hearts are the most tender and chocolaty of all hearts. http://www.goats.com/archive/040119.html

In 1986, Roy Cohn's demonic soul left his body and raged its way towards Hell, where it would stand beside Satan himself as a lieutenant and sperm receptacle. / / On its way, however, it would stop briefly at Jerry's Old-Fashioned Egg Farm on the outskirts of Plainsboro, New Jersey. / / There, Cohn's ectoplasmic residue forced itself upon a tender virgin hen, impregnating it with his malignant seed. http://www.goats.com/archive/040121.html

Some days later, a disheveled gentleman purchased a seemingly ordinary carton of eggs from his local convenience store. / / This gentleman, who raised me as a son, was the son of Nazi war criminal Loovis Von Herstreicher and a retired high school choir teacher. / / Loovis Junior adopted the twelve of us into his family of freakish torment. / On my third birthday I ripped his entrails out through his nostrils while he begged for his life. http://www.goats.com/archive/040123.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040126.html
Loovis Junior raised us with both hands -- a firm fist and a cruel open palm. We were soldiers, after all. Soldiers of the Fuhrer. / / Loovis Junior's father had penned such rousing German standards as "Das Fuhrer ist so Wundervolle" and "I liebe, Esel zu saugen". His own attempt at writing pro-Nazi ditties resulted in "99 Luftballoons", which was not as well received as he had hoped. / / But that didn't stop Loovis Junior from dreaming of a Fourth Reich: one fueled not by hatred and intolerance, but 80's guitar rock. http://www.goats.com/archive/040126.html

Sometimes I would sneak down to the basement with a pouch of Big League Chew and check on Ernesto. Being trapped in a small room with Hitler clones is not good for mental well-being. / How's it going? / Not good. / / We lost another clone. Brain function was severely reduced. He could only communicate in short, snarky asides laden with pop-culture references. / / Poor bastard. / I knocked him unconscious and put him on a truck full of IBM selectrics bound for Mexico. http://www.goats.com/archive/040130.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040202.html
How did you get down here, anyway? / I told Prosciutto someone parked an Iroc-Z down the street. It's time to bust out, Ernesto. / / It's too dangerous, Diablo. / Loovis wants to dress the choir in matching members only jackets. I cannot let that happen. I have a plan, but I need your help. / / Fine, what do you want me to do? / I want you to clone me a BILLION TIMES. http://www.goats.com/archive/040202.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/040204.html
No way. I'm not cloning you. / The sheer volume of Diablos that would result from a billiontuple-fold cloning would blow the roof right off the house. / / There's still the perimiter guard to get past. And we don't have the biomass to clone you a billion times. / How many times could you clone me? / / Umm... Twice. / We'll have to go with Plan B. How fat can you get? http://www.goats.com/archive/040204.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040206.html
After some debate, Ernesto and I agreed on a plan. / This plan sucks. What about T-Bone and Prosciutto? / Don't worry. You leave them to me. / / Maybe we should reconsider. Loovis isn't that bad / You're talking about a man who once ate a librarian. I think she might disagree with you. / / Sometimes I wish I was an autobot.

http://www.goats.com/archive/040209.html
Hey, you nerds! / T-Bone, did I hear correctly? Did some wiseguy just call us NERDS? / / Yes Mister Prosciutto. / You're in enough trouble as it is, Diablo. There was no Iroc-Z. And what is that egghead doing out of the basement? / / Ernesto has come to challenge T-Bone to an intricately choreographed tied-wrist knife fight. / Oh no. It's "amok time" all over again. http://www.goats.com/archive/040209.html

They let you go! Did it work? / / Yup. They're looting through your dead clone's pockets. / That Chinese finger puzzle I left them should keep them busy for a few hours. / / And now, with T-Bone and Prosciutto out of the way, Loovis Junior will fall. / I will crush his skull beneath the fearsome hooves of the ponies of vengeance. http://www.goats.com/archive/040213.html

click / And then, things moved quickly. We charged right into the middle of Thursday afternoon choir drills, clicking away like epileptic Hottentots. / / Loovis Junior was wicked scared of Hottentots. While he was still incapacitated by shock, I launched our secret weapon -- the Octohitler -- directly at his groin. / / The ensuing carnage was videotaped by novice fillmmakers Gumberto and Vonda, who sent it to America's Funniest Home Videos, where it won third place in the "Violent Groin Attacks" category. http://www.goats.com/archive/040216.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040218.html
Within minutes, Loovis was dead from testicular shock. / / My siblings, as if awakened from a long slumber, silently walked away from that house of horrors.

Finally I left home, and began my own amazing adventures, available in a separate volume, on sale this week only. / That's a stupid story. You're stupid. / / I'm glad you liked it. Vonda and Gumberto went on to pen a screenplay telling an eerily similar story which was optioned by the studios, secretly rewritten by Akiva Goldsman, and released later that year as Lethal Weapon 2. / / There wasn't any disembowelment in that story at all. / Oh, that.

Did you know that a cat's urine glows under a black light? / Just...just shut up. Shut UP. / / Don't you want to know how I found out about that juicy tidbit? / You and your funny little adventures and your mildy offensive nonsense. I've had enough of it. / / That's it. Starting today, I'm coming out of the closet of chaos. I challenge you to A VILLAINRY DUEL. / Note to self: Swedes will flip out at mention of pet excreta. http://www.goats.com/archive/040223.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040225.html
Fine. I accept your challenge. You know how these things work? / Of course. / / 1. Create alter-ego Examples: - Doctor Sun - Evil Boy - The Duke / The villainry duel begins with the traditional assumption of secret identity. Henchmen are procured, followed by armament, and then, the duel itself. Whomever commits the most villainous act within 24 hours wins, and whoever loses does not. / / So you play traditional rules! The's so quaint. It's like I'm competing with the Pope. / Hmm. Perhaps you are. http://www.goats.com/archive/040225.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/040227.html
Phillip! Dude! Bitchin' raiments! / Oh, but these are not just ordinary raiments, my friend. The are the raiments of the CHAOS POPE! / / Who's the Chaos Pope? / And what are you doing with his hat? / I'm the Chaos Pope. It's me. / / I wasn't aware you were into the whole popery scene. / I'm not, like, a full-blown popery freak or anything. Once a month, tops. http://www.goats.com/archive/040227.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040301.html
With you two lackey popes at my side, nothing stands between me and juicy, delicious victory. / Lackeys? We are no man's lackeys. / / For we are the ARCH-POPES! / With "chubby fingers of death" kung-fu grip. / / You can call yourselves "The Barons of Funk" for all I care, as long as you're functionally subservient to my evil whim. / I made you a thermos of soup. http://www.goats.com/archive/040301.html

Little girl! Do you beleve that God turned himself into a pork chop, which was given unto me, the CHAOS POPE, so that I may partake of his flesh and forge my pork-fueled wisdom into a fiery sword of church doctrine? / No. / / Then you shall perish from the Earth, and at the end of your days you will spend the rest of eternity in a lake of fire, wearing a swimsuit of fire, taking swimming lessons from Joan Rivers impersonators. Who are on fire. / / WWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA / I believe! I believe! / Then give us your money. http://www.goats.com/archive/040303.html

You there! With the ice cream! Stop in the name of all that is holy. / Me? / / You BARBARIAN.

You know, I'm not so sure about this pope stuff anymore. It seems wrong. / Well, I can't get enough popery. I love it! / / Yeah. Me too. / The irrational doctrines, the infallibility, the self-contradicting source material, the willful disregard for logic, and... the MONEY. Oh, the money. I think I've found religion, Bob. / / But what about love, Neil? Is there any room in your funny pope hat for LOVE? http://www.goats.com/archive/040308.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/040310.html
What the hell are you talking about? / I'm talking about love, Neil. Our forbidden love. / / I've waited a long time for you, and I won't wait any longer. Marry me, Neil. / Sure, why not. I'm free on Thursday. / / But the church forbids marriage between male extra-terrestrial popes. / Who would have thought my flagrant discriminatory behavior would have come back to haunt me? Oh, cruel irony, I flip the bird at thee! http://www.goats.com/archive/040310.html

This sucks. Now we'll never get to have church-approved sweaty gay pope sex. / How could the church betray us like this? / / Perhaps an influential external agent has gotten a bit too close to the chaos pope. / Musta been the communists. They've got their greasy claws in everything these days. / / Trotsky again, eh? But why? / Having no religion of their own to sustain them, the commies crave the delicious flavor of Phillip's pork chop god. http://www.goats.com/archive/040312.html

~ Slightly later ~ / So you say the Communists are responsible for everything wrong in my life? / Including the icky feeling you get when you watch gay porn. / / I hate that feeling! How did Communists get that feeling inside of me? / We suspect they used some sort of pump. Have you seen Trotsky around here lately? / / He stopped by for a short while earlier in the afternoon to show me his brand new bicycle pump. / That devious bastard. It's going to take more than an ice pick to stop him this time. http://www.goats.com/archive/040315.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040317.html
I need to get those goddamned pinkos out of my head. / The only way to defeat them is to wed us immediately. / / But what about the icky feeling? / You don't want to be a communist, do you? / They'll take all your pope money and give to freaking orphans, man. / / Fine. By the pork chop ingested by me, I pronounce you husband and other husband. / SWEET! I get to be on top. http://www.goats.com/archive/040317.html

Ah, cripes. Diablo's going to be back in fifteen minutes. What villainy can we commit in fifteen minutes? / Ooh! Pancakes! / / What? / Sorry. I have logorrhea. / / What's logorrhea? Could it be used for evil? / Probably. Nothing good ends in "rhea". / Go go gadget cannibalism! http://www.goats.com/archive/040319.html

Okay. We have six minutes. Let's construct a doomsday device. What available materials do we have on hand? / Cocktail strainer? / Salt shaker! / / That's a start. You...um...begin straining the salt. / If only we had a length of tubing. Dman you, tubing! / / Look! They fit together! / Why are there never any weapons of mass destruction around when you need them? / Tell me about it. http://www.goats.com/archive/040322.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040324.html
All right. Now we're talkin'. How many people will this thing take out? / None, actually. / / That's not very effective for a doomsday cannon, is it? / It's not bad considering all we've got for ammo is lemons. / Lemons aren't very deadly. / / Beware, nincom-popes! Lemons may not be deadly, but CHEF DAS-TARD-LEE and his trusted sidekick SPATULA BOY will excommunicate your skinny papal asses with a delicate lemon custard of DOOM. / Word. http://www.goats.com/archive/040324.html

All right, Karlsson. Ante up. What was your villainous act? / We... uh... tied a guy to a tree. / Tightly. / / That's it? / And we frightened some children. / They had it coming. / Like you could do better. / / Tell them, Spatula Boy. / We made a giant frittata from the eggs of endangered tree frogs and force-fed it to P.E.T.A. members at gunpoint. http://www.goats.com/archive/040326.html

You guys definitely win. / The wombat cheese was a nice touch. / That was Oliver's idea. / I frickin' hate wombats. / / And now, for my prize, I demand that the three popes show their subservience by being our slaves, forever, until the end of time. / That wasn't the deal. / / And what forefit do you think would be fair? / Uh... torturous... naked... lady... wrestling. / Or we could eat ricotta cheese until we lose consciousness. http://www.goats.com/archive/040329.html

Look. You're not so bright, so I'll let you in on a secret. Big people are exactly the same as little people. They're selfish, squabbling children whose motivations are jealousy and greed. No one becomes big when they hit adulthood. They just become better at hiding how small they are. / / Big is about attitude. You want to be big? Act big. Act bad. Hide your smallness behind agression or multisyllabic words or some other crutch. Like one of these. / I...I can't. / / Too good for a smoke, eh?

A secret life? This ought to be good. / You have to promise not to tell anyone. ANYONE! / / Sure thing.

http://www.goats.com/archive/040409.html
See, this whole Red Bull thing is just a matter of perspective. Sure, you and I know it means you're a weak and flawed individual who cannot be trusted around children. But with the right spin, I believe we can make this marketable / Okay. / / You're not an addict. You're a go-go hipster with a can-do attitdue, and you have an affinity for the beverage because it's the only way you can give 110% for the kids. / Why do you keep mentioning children? / / This is going to work. I think we can get you a sponsorship. Sign right here, pal. / Just like a famous person! http://www.goats.com/archive/040409.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040412.html
Why am I wearing a monkey-shaped backpack? / You like it? It's a behavioural conditioning technique and a subtle literary device all at the same time. / / Those tubes deliver a steady supply of concentrated energy drink suffused with 0.02% concentration depleted uranium particulate directly into your burger-hole. / / It makes my mouth and lungs all tingly! / That's perfect.Say that again, but this time play to the camera. http://www.goats.com/archive/040412.html

Be warned, Mister Senor Swanky, this will not stand! / So you guys have this under control, right? 'Cause I gotta boogie. / / Not so fast.

Okay, ladies, here's the plan. We construct a giant killer robot by cannibalizing parts from Neil and Bob's spaceship. / It's been done. / / Fine, Doctor Weenie von Smarty-Pants.

REESE? is... is it really you? / Yes, it's me, as seen in Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde. It grossed $79 million just in domestic release! / / This is amazing! What are you doing here? / Well, technically none of this is real. This is a mental projection that your mind has created to shelter you from the intense psychological shock of turning into a giant fishmonster. / / Just thinking about it makes my tummy hurt. / No, that's acid reflux. You just ate a mailman. http://www.goats.com/archive/040428.html

This is great! You have weird taste in decor, but I think we're totally going to be friends while I'm here. / While you're here? Where are you going? / / Well, once you've taken control over the fishmonster persona and regained autonomy, you won't need me around any more. / But I don't know how to do that. I'm just a tiny fish. / / It's okay. I'll help you. Let's visualize the fishmonster consciousness as a physical entity that we can confront. / Robert Goulet! http://www.goats.com/archive/040430.html

Can I ask you something? / / Sure. / Can you get me a glass of water to breathe? http://www.goats.com/archive/040514.html

You've gotten this place cleaned up pretty quickly. / Yeah, we outsource construction to India. They do job very fast and very cheap. / / You can't outsource construction. / Sure you can! You can outsource anything now. See? I save ten dollars! / / You must be very proud of yourself. / Oh yes. Now I go spend ten dollars on new Angelina Jolie autobiography "More Than Lips". http://www.goats.com/archive/040517.html

I think the bar is a different color now. / How's Fish? I'm glad you asked. He's doing just fine. / / It's either more green, or more purple. Either way, this is not a good development. / Although he does keep trying to beat himself into unconsciousness. / / I'm going to go get a dozen brown magic markers. / I think you've huffed quite enough objects for one lifetime. http://www.goats.com/archive/040519.html

Free porn for Phillip Karlsson! / Well, I wouldn't normally read this sort of thing, you understand. / / But if it's free, well, I'm open-minded enough to... wait. This isn't porn. / Looks like a subpoena. / / This isn't even close to porn. This is the OPPOSITE of porn. / "Fish Pinkerton and Oliver Malcolm X vs. Sporkle Corp." http://www.goats.com/archive/040521.html

They're claiming that our Sporkle Xtreme energy beverage-style product is responsible for Fish's transformation and general post-transformational malaise. / So? Write them a check. / / They want your collection of antique bingo chips. / Those BASTARDS. I will defend my honor in hand-to-hand combat! / / Would you put that down?

We're going to need a new lawyer. Our current one is very dead. / You know what would be more fun for you than three weeks of legal proceedings? / / What? / Spending three weeks manning my booth for me at a comics convention in Las Vegas, Nevada. / / Do I get to beat up nerds? / That depends on how close you can get to them.

Elfies / We're going where? / I got a letter from the head arrangement fellow of DOR-CON 17. Apparently, he is in charge of arranging things. / / Xeroxed letterhead. Classy! / I, the auteur of online comic phenomenon MEGAGAMERZ 3L33T, have been invited to appear as a Dor-Con guest of honor. / / You have seven readers, and four of those are Google search bots. / And yet I can still go unrecognized on the street, which is nice.

Did you catch that wizard at the front of the hotel? / No. Really? / He's animatronic. / / Don't be so harsh, Dude. Wizards need love too. / Yeah. Don't be a wizard-hater. / I just meant that he's not a real wizard. / / Not like we used to have back in the day, but the economy isn't all it used to be. / Oh man.

I have my first panel in twelve minutes. You two go set up our stuff at the booth. There may be some other folks there already. Try not to scare them off too quickly. / Nerds? / / A bunch of lowlife emo-candyraver drug-addled web-cartoonists I'm loosely associated with. We have a sort of mutual non-aggression pact. / Like S.A.L.T.? / / I used to, but now I'm on a low-sodium diet! / That's Rich.

Strange people are approaching. Over there, on the horizon. / Good job Jeff! I'm going to purchase a small treat for you. / / A case of Tecate. NO. Twenty cases.

Fascinating. It's like watching a National Geographic special on inebriates. / / Yup.

Hello fellow Americans. We've been invited here to speak on the occasion of the 1500th Goats comic strip. / / Now normally, Dick doesn't like to associate himself with folks like you. He's still sore from when the gays made his daughter all fruity. plus, he says I'll probably embarass him again. / / But I told him that we have to make the first move towards a non-partisan country. We must take these sorts of opportunicalities to reach out to you liberal fruitcakes and try to show you the error of your ways. / / Like this whole Iraq war doo-dad. You're making way too much of a fuss over it, if you look at it all analytical-like. Sure, it's an "illegal war". Sure, we made up some stuff to get the whole mess goin'. / / But lookit all the good that's coming out of it. First off, our war crimes ain't half as bad as the ones Saddam was pullin' off. Secret murders are way down. And you gotta admit some o' them torture pics were pretty funny. / / But the thing that we have to remember is that we're good. We're the good guys! And that means anyone who is fighting us or disagrees with us is EVIL and WRONG. / / The Bible - By God / And how do I know that we're the good guys? Because it says so in the Bible. And how could he love me if I was doin' anything wrong? / / So, to recap, Jesus loves me. And Jesus loves Dick. / / I bet he can't get enough Dick, you know? I know I can't. / Cut his mic! http://www.goats.com/archive/040611.html

Hello, and welcome to Dor-Con's webcomics panel. I'm Andrew Bell. I'll be your host. BWA-HAHA! Let's introduce our panelists. / / Our first webcomics artist hails from the most mediocre parts of New Jersey. Let's give it up for Jeff "Zugs" Zugale! / Woo! Woo! / / What panel would be complete without this blue-haired methane factory? It's Darren Bleuel! / Why won't you love me? Why!? / Woo! http://www.goats.com/archive/040614.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040616.html
Our next panelist is Scott Kurtz, the man behind minimalist experimental drama-comic PVP. / I know Frank Cho. / / And who doesn't love the wacky antics of Gabe and Tycho? / I don't know, but they're going to get their windpipes crushed when I find them. / / And our final panelist is, apparently, some sort of seabird. / I'm a chicken. http://www.goats.com/archive/040616.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040618.html
I think we're just going to go right ahead and take some questions from our audience members. / Woo! / / A question for Gabe and Tycho. Why don't you look more like your characters? / / Because I'm going to rip off your face if you don't sit down and shut up, that's why. You'll be napping with REAGAN. / Ooh. Lemme write that one down. http://www.goats.com/archive/040618.html

I never thought you'd sink so low. Running off, leaving our poor friend Fish in a state of befuddlement and poverty, unable to pay even the smallest of legal bills. As his attorney, I demand that you give me all your money. / / Well, that's too bad, but Sporkle Corp does not negotiate with terrorists, giant killer robots, or lawyers. It's company policy, and there's nothing you can do about it. / / There certainly is. I'm going to murder everyone at this convention, one by one, until you learn some respect for THE LAW. http://www.goats.com/archive/040625.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040628.html
Well, thanks for coming to our panel folks. I suggest you all take this time to run screaming for the exits. I plan on doing the same. / / That's not fair! I didn't get a chance to answer any quest- / / THWOCK / / Woo! http://www.goats.com/archive/040628.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040630.html
KACHUNK KACHUNK / Diablo, what the hell have you done now? / Don't blame this one on me. It appears my child is a bit of a prodigy. / / THWOCK / BLAM! BLAM! / This is not something to be proud of. All the ladies dressed like sexy tigers are hamburger meat. The stormtroopers are trying to fight off the robot, but they keep missing. / / And the goths keep bursting into tears, but there's some conjecture that may be normal. / But the anime fans are eating it up. http://www.goats.com/archive/040630.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040701.html
Now we're REALLY going to need a new lawyer. / You know what would be more fun than fending off a giant robot attack? / / What? / Getting in the car and driving very fast towards New York. / / THWOCK / Because running away worked for you so very well the first time. / Have faith. It may take a few times before we get it right. http://www.goats.com/archive/040701.html

Hi, sweetie! / Jon! What are you doing home from your trip so early? / / Why do you ask? Because you have a secret harem of naked men pleasing you sexually in the bedroom? / No, because I'm happy to see you. / / Oh. I suppose that could be possible. / Not that I couldn't have a harem if I wanted to. http://www.goats.com/archive/040705.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040707.html
So we've still got the rental car for the next few days. I was thinking we could take a romantic trip, maybe go hiking? / / You, a boy who stays inside so much he is startled by clouds, want to go camping in the woods. Outside. / Yes. Quickly. / / Is something trying to kill you again? / Of course not. But we should bring Phillip and Diablo with us, just in case. http://www.goats.com/archive/040707.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040709.html
I have porn for the drive. Porn for everyone. / Where did you get that? / / The guy in the orange suit keeps delivering it. There was a pile waiting for me at home. / You were in charge of bringing sandwiches. / / But I brought porn instead. / Porn: It's what's for dinner! http://www.goats.com/archive/040709.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040712.html
Here we are. Harriman State Park. Bear Mountin. / Bears are the natural enemy of the chicken. / I don't see any bears. / / They were all sold off to White Castle in the sixties. / There are no bears. We're not going up the mountain anyway. / / We're going to check out a side trail that leads to an abandoned village. / Doodletown? http://www.goats.com/archive/040712.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040714.html
Legend has it that during the revolutionary war, British troops marched through the town on their way to battle North of here. / / As they marched, the troops sang "Yankee Doodle" in an effort to demoralize the townspeople. But the citizens picked up the tune, taking it for their own, even going so far as to rename their village after it. / / I don't believe that for a second. / Why not? / It's boring. http://www.goats.com/archive/040714.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/040716.html
They don't want you to know what happened here, but the truth is that Doodletown was like an Auschwitz for chickens. / / Home to a colony of antichickeners, Doodletown was a mecca for anti-chicken activity. Doodleites bred bears over on the mountain for the express purpose of destroying the chicken people. / Rar. / / Are you done yet? / Trivia tidbit: Kwanzaa was originally conceived to commemorate the great chicken-bear massacree of 1869. http://www.goats.com/archive/040716.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040719.html
Despite what Diablo would have you believe, Doodletown was an isolated and mostly peaceful village. Time passed quietly there. / / The townspeople made a meager but fair living chopping ice out of the nearby lake and carting it down to Manhattan, where ice was apparently hard to come by. Modern refriderants sealed the demise of their economy, and the town dissolved in April of 1965. / / THAT'S IT. I've had enough of this revisionist propaganda. / She's a witch! Burn her! http://www.goats.com/archive/040719.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040721.html
Great. Diablo's run off. / What exactly just happened? / / Maybe you and your holocaust-denying friends should get together and have a little chat about that. Maybe over tea and cookies. Heartless, cruel cookies that you eat while rewriting history to your liking. / / Thanks. That clears everything up. / Acutally, if you've got any cookies left over afterwards, can I have them? / He likes cookies a lot. http://www.goats.com/archive/040721.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040723.html
Regardless of who is mistaken in their history, we need to split up and find Diablo before he gets hurt. / Why? / / Good point. Okay, we need to find him before he sets fire to things. / Why? / / Because Smokey would be peeved if we burned down his forest after all that advertising he paid for. / Once again, the iron grip of the bears holds us in its clammy paws of evil. http://www.goats.com/archive/040723.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040726.html
It's getting dark, so we need to hurry. Megan, you search along the trail. I'll head into the woods north of here. Phillip, you take the south. / / Just like general Grant! Or the Muppets. / I thought the Muppets took Manhattan. / / Manhattan is south of here, isn't it? Isn't it, mister righty mcrighty-all-the-time? / Go. Now. Don't feel obliged to come back too quickly. http://www.goats.com/archive/040726.html

He thinks he's so much better than me? Pah! They will all bow before me when I strut my superior detective skills and find Diablo first. / / For I have the OVER-CLOCKED LEMON! / Lemon, go forth into the darkness of these woods and search for a chicken. / / I am a creature of the night http://www.goats.com/archive/040728.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040730.html
Roll faster, puny lemon! Bring me chickens! / / Or other stuff. That's fine too. Stuff is awesome. / / Well hello there. / You? What the hell are you doing here? http://www.goats.com/archive/040730.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040802.html
Hello? Diablo? / Calling for the devil in these woods is a foolhardy proposition. / / OH! Uh, excuse me sir, but you startled me. I was just looking or a lost chicken. Have you seen one? / / There are several chickens in my village, which is nearby here. Perhaps the chicken you seek is amongst them. http://www.goats.com/archive/040802.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/040803.html
Perhaps the town eldress can help you find your chicken. / Excuse me, but...is this Doodletown? / / Why yes, it is. You have heard of our little community? / I thought Doodletown was uninhabited. / / Oh, that silly rumor. / Our town is not quite dead as you may have heard. http://www.goats.com/archive/040803.html

Look what I got for Christmas! The new Sony codpiece, imported from Japan! / I got a box for Christmas. / / The Sony codpiece has 256 megs of RAM. / I can put stuff in the box and make it fight until only one stuff leaves. / / The Sony codpiece plays the theme from Hawaii 5-0 when you get aroused. / I think Toothgnip hates me. http://www.goats.com/archive/030106.html

What the hell do you have on your face? / You like it? It's an ironic Hitler moustache. / / Take that off before someone beats you. / It's okay, because it's ironic. You can take all sorts of offensive things and make them hip with the magic of irony. / / There's nothing ironic about Hitler. / I suppose you don't find anything funny about ironic baby fucking, either. http://www.goats.com/archive/030108.html

Hey, Jon. / Scott Horowitz! Holy frijoles, it's been a long time! What are you doing here? / / Oh, just wandering. You know. / Oh yeah. He's still pissed, huh? / / Yeah. I guess I'll go wander some more. / Well, it was good seeing you. http://www.goats.com/archive/030113.html

They're running excerpts from the recently-discovered long-lost tell-all Suess diaries. / Please, go on. / / May 19, 1974 -- I got real drunk with Kissinger, snogged his wife and diddled her! Smoked some weed with Elton John, then chugged a glass of Perignon. We talked of Grinches and of Sneeches, then his hand went down my breeches. / / I told him, "No! I am not gay! Not in my butt! Not any way!" / Elton John is gay? http://www.goats.com/archive/030115.html

What are you doing? / I'm over-clocking this lemon. / / I didn't know you could do that to a lemon. / Soon, I will have the most powerful lemons in the universe. / / What is your command oh exalted master http://www.goats.com/archive/030117.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030120.html
Why have you created me oh master / I was bored, I guess. / / What is the purpose of my existence / There is none, really. / / My universe is pain and emptiness / Great. I've created a Goth lemon. http://www.goats.com/archive/030120.html

Give me purpose oh beloved creator / Okay. Um, go forth and vanquish my enemies. / / I have no means of locomotion / Fine.

What's the layer of Earth between the crust and the core called? / Vanilla. / / I thought it was the Mantle. / No, that's a baseball player. / / So you're saying that there's a thick layer of vanilla-coated baseball players under the gorund. / They come out at night to do product endorsements. http://www.goats.com/archive/030127.html

You know, it's strange, but I think I actually miss Diablo. / Things are rather dull here without him. / / There's no one cloning prop comics. / No one writing bank names under "Jesus Saves" billboards. / / No one relabeling the windex as "Essence of Gelfling". / Gelfling or no, it still tastes good. http://www.goats.com/archive/030129.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030131.html
Something's not right. Diablo's been gone for too long. / I'm getting worried too. / / That's it. I'm going to go out and look for him. / I don't think you're going to need to. / / Shinobi is back! http://www.goats.com/archive/030131.html

Gah. Lo-L-Lo-Lo-L-Lo-Lo-L / Hello, Jon. You're just as articulate as always. / / Ah, Lori.

http://www.goats.com/archive/030205.html
Diablo, where in the world have you been? Why is Lori here? Why isn't she a zombie anymore? / / Well, Jon, it's a long, convoluted and almost entirely true story. As you know, I blamed myself for Fish's untimely demise. It was my misguided advice that drove him to his tragic end, and I felt guilty as a Catholic version of O.J. Simpson. / / There was only one man with the scientific expertise to help me right the wrongs I had brought about. And there was only one man courageous (or insane) enough to help me convince him to do it. http://www.goats.com/archive/030205.html

After catching a cheap flight to Belgium on Jefferson Airlines (the new startup airline with a brand-new fleet of Jefferson Airplanes and unlimited peanuts), I made my way to the outskirts of Brussels. / / The trip through the countryside was fraught with danger. Dangerous danger. Sheep were everywhere, gazing at me with bloodthirsty eyes, grazing viciously in their meadows of death. I walked quickly. / / Sanitarium / It was two days before I reached my destination: Incontinent Eddie's Sanitorium and Pachinko Palace (Eddie's new business venture, the brunchery having long since gone the way of Pam Dauber's Career). / It was two days before I reached my destination: Incontinent Eddie's Sanatorium and Pachinko Palace (Eddie's new business venture, the brunchery having long since gone the way of Pam Dauber's Career). http://www.goats.com/archive/030207.html

Shazam Twix, My robotic-limbed mentor from the fields of Epernay, had voluntarily committed himself after a particularly harrowing session of "Waffle Diddlers Anonymous" had brought memories of his dalliance with Menstrua, Queen of the Kotex, gushing out from his cerebrum like that gum with the squishy center. / / In an effort to quelch the reawakened feelings of longing and betrayal at the hands of super-minx Menstrua, Twix retreated to the psychological safety of padded walls and apple juice afternoons. Years of Chex Mix abuse had left him ill-equipped to deal with rejection. / / Twix spent his long, dreary days working with the other patients, teaching them how to impale things with a meat thermometer and how to glue popsicle sticks to their foreheads. He spent his nights screaming in horror. http://www.goats.com/archive/030210.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030212.html
I found Twix in the sanitarium's cafeteria, writing and re-writing potential online personal ads on the back of paper napkins (the safe king with the sharp edged removed) with a piece of ketchup-soaked wonder bread. "Shazam!" I yelled, trying to get his attention. He glanced at the ceiling, barked loudly, and returned to his scribbles. / / I walked over to his trable and caught his eye, but there was no recognition. I recounted our adventures trying to stir his memory: fighting the hyper-weasels of finland. Battling the market-droids of SuperAwesomeCorp. Eating flan during the Fabulous Flan Floods of '93. None of it broke through his trance. / / Resigned, I sat across from him and corrected his spelling and grammar as he wrote his personal ads (well-hung pastry chef seeks hairy dwarf-lady for sucking jello through straws, midnight walks), my tears smearing the ketchup-enscribed come-ons as I proofed them. http://www.goats.com/archive/030212.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030214.html
I edited Twix's lascivious personal ads (which, bound in a single column, would approximate a sort of Kama Sutra for breakfast food aficionados) one by one, until he had but a single paper napkin in front of him. Slowly, Twix looked up at me for the first time with clear eyes and passed me the final note. / / Help. I am trapped in a small jar next to Jerry Lewis in a cave in southern New Jersey. Please help me escape. Thank you for your time and consideration. Your friend, / The note, scrawled in his childlike handwriting, said "Middle-aged robotic-limbed Belgian seeks Satan-worshipping chicken for adventures, kicking ass, and general mayhem. Must like bocce and forgiving self-pitying whiners for their occasional lapses in mental faculty and their sexual transgressions with underage waffles. / / Twix stood up, dusted himself off, and turned to me with the same disarming smile he had used to deflower all those champagne cellar tour guides those many years ago. "Diablo," he said, "did you know that in West Virginia, it is against the law for non-babies to ride in baby carriages?" / He was back. http://www.goats.com/archive/030214.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030217.html
After helping ourselves to some apple cobbler (which had turned out to be load-bearing cobbler, bringing down the cafeteria and the rest of the sanitarium in a glorious pile of screaming bodies and rubble), we made our way to the nearest high-speed hovercraft budget rental outfit. / / Roar! / We crossed the sea of Brussels under cover of darkness, making our way towards Gregor Mendel's lair, knowing full well that he did not like us and was probably still miffed about all the times we had killed him previously. Suddenly, a vicious shark reared out of the water! But then it went away. / / We finally made it to the opposite shore, just outside the sleepy, tiny hamlet of Ouderengaardefleurn, where Mendel's castle lay. It was a risky mission, and there was no guarantee that any of us would survive. I released the hovercraft, setting it free. We watched in silence as the hovercraft made it's way to safety, floating ever higher and higher into the night sky. http://www.goats.com/archive/030217.html

Boarded up window with sinister eyes peeping out. / Mendel's castle lay at the top of an angry pile of rock jutting out above the quiet, sleepy town. But as we strolled the empty streets of Ouderengaardefleurn, it became clear that not everything was asleep. Beady eyes and grasping fingers poked out from behind boarded windows and under porches. / / We quickened our pace, aware that we were being tracked by some sinister force, something far darker than even Mendel's genetic tampering was capable of, like a sitcom reunion special, or a Taco Bell soda fountain with the Pepsi syrup output turned way down. / / Whatever we sensed, they let us pass through the town unharmed, perhaps kept at bay by a disturbingly steady stream of Twix's world-famous robotic armpit farts, or perhaps, by the twisted hand of fate. But fate appreciates irony, because while we were escaping that unknown threat, we walked right into another. / BRAP BRAP http://www.goats.com/archive/030219.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030221.html
In our rush to escape the vague dread instilled in us by the ghoulish town, we ran straight into one of Mendel's patrols of his sentient mutant pea-plant henchmen. Twix began to hack away at their tentacles with his machete, but we were quickly overcome by their sheer numbers. / / With their long, hard, throbbing protuberances wrapped around our lithe, tender bodies, there was little we could do. The pea plants carried us like a pair of knock-off Fendi handbags up the slope of the rocky outcropping towards Gregor Mendel's stony lair, where certain death (and tacky faux-medieval interior decoration) awaited us. / / Once inside the castle, we were shackled in the dungeon/breakfast nook, roughed up a bit, and given our choice of herbal tea. Just then, Mendel himself entered the room, wringing his hands like impish towels soaked in the cast-off sweat of Natalie Imbruglia. "Hello, friends," he said. "Care for a scone? A scone of DOOM?!?" http://www.goats.com/archive/030221.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030224.html
While Twix became visibly aroused at the mere mention of scones, I kept my cool, like Steve McQueen's corpse in an interstellar void. "We're not here for your demented pastry, Mendel," I spat at him. "We've come because... Well... We need your help." Mendel's twisted smile of schadenfreude twisted into a twisted smirk of surprise. / / "You want my help?" he laughed, clearly enjoying his power over us. "Whatever for?" Swallowing my pride, I explained to him what had happened to Fish; the events leading up to his suicide and how I had caused it. "Fish is dead," I said, "And we need your help to make him less dead." / / "It would be an intriguing challenge," Mendel mused. "And the fish lives in a beer mug, you say? I find that strangely amusing. Yes, I think I will help you, my chickeny nemesis. But there will be a price to be paid for my assistance. And the cost will be higher than a Volkswagen bus full of hippies on a mountaintop." http://www.goats.com/archive/030224.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030226.html
"The small town below us used to be filled with cheerful villagers, going about their dreary lives with their Sony Walkmen and their sugarless gum," Mendel continued. "But over the years, they have slowly been drawn into a cult... A cult based on the worship of a zombie who promotes the practice of ritual cannibalism." / / "You mean Catholics?" I asked. "No, not Catholics," Mendel responded. "These cultists are even worse. They make Catholics look like small potatoes. I admit that I am uncertain as to where they procure the potato costumes from, and clueless as to how they coerce the Catholics to wear them, however. But that is unimportant." / / "If I am to help you revive your friend, I will need you to go into the town below, infiltrate the cultists, kidnap their zombie leader, and bring him back to me. We will need the zombie to achieve our goal. It is unlikely that you will survive, but if you do, please bring back some Diet Pepsi. I am very thirsty." http://www.goats.com/archive/030226.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030228.html
Look, it's pretty obvious where this is going. Lori is obviously the zombie cult leader. You infiltrated the cult, fought off their battalion of evil zombie corn dog warriors, and captured her in a magical net made from the golden locks of Ann Landers. So, in the interests of time and sanity, can we just pick up the story there? / / You selfish, cold-hearted bastard, you've made him cry. / I... *sniff* I just wanted to tell a story... / / I can't believe this. / It's okay, Diablo. Take your time. / The corn-dog battle... it was *sniff* glorious... / Were the corn dogs beautiful? http://www.goats.com/archive/030228.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030303.html
It took all of our strength to keep Lori restrained. She was a snarling, blood-thirsty beast, determined to devour us alive. Once we returned to the castle with our captive, Mendel took her off to his laboratory, where he shut himself in for the next three days and nights. / / Just as I had finally come to terms with Lori's sudden and unexpected reappearance, she was whisked away once more. While the cultists beat helplessly against the castle walls, screaming for her return, Mendel worked feverishly as he pried the secrets of the undead from Lori's unholy living corpse. / / As the sun set on the third day, the cultists ended their siege, and Mendel emerged from the lab with a small vial of zombie essence, a re-animated (and very relaxed looking) Lori, and a cigarette. "Was it good for you?" he asked slyly. "I feel like a new woman," Lori replied. http://www.goats.com/archive/030303.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030305.html
"This vial contains all the vital zombie humours you'll need to reanimate your fishy friend," Mendel said as he passed me the test tube. "I've renoodled the proportions I've extracted from your zombie friend to compensate for the brain frenzy and to boost their efficiency, of course." / / "And as for you, my dark temptress," he said to Lori, "are you sure you won't reconsider my generous offer?" "Perhaps some day," she answered. I never did find out what Mendel was referring to, but it probably had absolutely nothing to do with DIRTY, DIRTY SEX. / / "Well, normally at this point, I would double-cross you or something, but I'm feeling pretty good. You're all free to go," Mendel said, and sent us on our way with some Cheese 'n' Cracker Snack Packs (the kind with the little red plastic stick that you can use to smear the cheese on the crackers). http://www.goats.com/archive/030305.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030307.html
So we said goodbye to Twix, and caught the next bus back to New York. The only thing that's left to do now is to go dig up Fish's corpse. / / Even assuming that you can bring Fish back to life with what appears to be a tube full of Sprite, there's probably not much raw material left to work with, if you catch my drift. / / Jon, he lived in a glass of alcohol. Fish is probably better preserved than most fetal pigs I know. / Ooh! Can I come? I haven't gone graverobbing in weeks. http://www.goats.com/archive/030307.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030310.html
So you're all buddy-buddy with Diablo, now? / Well, he did save me from a rather gruesome and boring un-death. / / You're saying all that stuff he said was true? / To be honest, it's all a little fuzzy. I don't remember anything clearly. / / So you're giving him the benefit of the doubt, of course. / The idea that I was being worshipped like a dark goddess is very credible. http://www.goats.com/archive/030310.html

http://www.goats.com/archive/030319.html
So you were the king of marmalade, eh? / Oh yes! It was grand. These were all sorts of jellies and jams. / / I married the princess of grape preserves and there was a baked goods parade and we made babies from a recipe that her grandmother gave her for her birthday but then people wanted to eat the babies and that wasn't too good. But then they didn't eat the babies so that was okay. / / I'd say you've suffered from oxygen deprivation, but with you, it's hard to be certain. / Baruch ata Adonay, Eloheinu Melech Ha?Olam Borei Pri Hagafen / Blessed art thou Lord, our God, King of the world, who created the fruit of the vine. http://www.goats.com/archive/030319.html

Welcome to Crab City, population 3,000,000. Crab City is made for crabs, by crabs, from crabs. / We're damned proud of it. / / But that doesn't mean Crab City doesn't have its dark side. / Lust. / Greed. / Poisonous pits of boiling tar. / MURDER. / / Me? My name is Samuel. Samuel Greeley. / I'm an accountant. http://www.goats.com/archive/030418.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030421.html
I've worked here at H&R Pufnstuff going on three years now. I don't make much, partially because there's no money in Crab City -- only crabs -- but the coffee is damned fine, and the job is easy. / / H&R Pufnstuff CPAs / I worked nights because of an intensely disturbing but survivable tragedy in my past which I'd rather not talk about, if you don't mind. / / But all that changed the night Rococo Wattles skittered into my office. http://www.goats.com/archive/030421.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030423.html
I recognized Miss Wattles immediately. Daughter of tennis ball magnate Francis Wattles, the society pages had long declared her Crab City's most eligible Bachelorette. / / What was a dame like this doing in my low-rent neighborhood? Surely the Wattles family had the best accountants that their non-existent money could buy. / Something was very wrong here. / / I decided to play it cool. / I love your balls, Miss Wattles. I play with them all the time. http://www.goats.com/archive/030423.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030425.html
They won't be my balls for long, Mr. Greeley. Not unless you can help me. Wattles Tennis Balls Inc. is the target of a corporate takeover. / / They're going to dismantle the company. / Your father would never let that happen. / / "My father is dead, Mr. Greeley. He was crushed to death last week in an accident on the factory floor." / "Crushed to death by his own balls." http://www.goats.com/archive/030425.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030428.html
I've got to protect my father's company, Mr Greeley. Will you help me? / But why me? You've got your own accountants. / / None that I can trust. They think we should sell. / Something stinks here, Baby, and it ain't me. / I know 'cause I've showered. / / But sometimes you can't get to the truth with just a bar of soap. Sometimes, if you want to get the bare facts, you've got to scrub really really hard, with a washcloth. / I'm you're man, Miss Wattles. I'm your washcloth of justice. http://www.goats.com/archive/030428.html

Rococo left me with a stack of corporate tax forms and a lingering kiss on the cheek. / Something about this case was giving me the creeps. I felt strange, like when you're enjoying a very delicious turkey and ham sandwich which then turns out not to be a sandwich at all, but a severed head. / Or tuna fish. / It was time to call in the big boys. I went to see Knowledgeable Pete, a hermit crab I knew who lived on the outskirts of Crab City. / If anyone could figure out the crazy, mixed-up hullabaloo this dame had gotten herself into, it was good ol'Pete. http://www.goats.com/archive/030430.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030502.html
I found Pete on his porch, musing over some paperwork. / Sam! Long time. What brings you out this way? / Actuarial tables, eh? / / / What can I say, Sam. Retirement never did agree with me, and a crab's gotta do something for fun in his declining years. / So what can I do for you? / / I'm on a case, Knowledgeable Pete. The kind of case that takes your very soul and puts it in a tiny box and then puts a hamster on top of that box. / And that hamster never moves, Pete. The hamster never moves again. http://www.goats.com/archive/030502.html

Ah, here we are. The gentlemen who are out to take over your client's company are partners in the Heartless Bastard Holding Company. / And? / / If memory serves, that's the same firm that employs Miss Wattles' accountants. / Impossible. That would violate the stringent accountant's code of morality and ethics. / / Wake up, Sam! That code's written on an Etch-a-Sketch. The real question is, what would accountants want with a tennis ball factory? / For the dames, Pete. Dames love factories. http://www.goats.com/archive/030519.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030521.html
I suspect it's not the company they're after, Sam. It's the company's assets. / This says they own a tennis ball factory, a foozball table and two hotels on Baltic Avenue. / / It's not about what's on record. It's about what's off it. If you look closely here, where it says "Criminal Activities"... / Blam! / / Pete!!! / *Gasp* / That... / *Cough* / That was so rude. http://www.goats.com/archive/030521.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030523.html
Sam...*gasp* Sam, come closer. / Yes, Knowledgeable Pete? / Look at...*cough* look at their K-14 Forms...There you will find the truth. And... / / And *gasp* don't make the same mistake I made. / Marrying an omelette? / No, Sam. Don't spend your life alone. / Sure. Anything else? / / Avenge me, son. Avenge my death. / Fine. Listen, I really should run. / And take good care of your teeth. http://www.goats.com/archive/030523.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030526.html
I beat a path out of there, hotwired Pete's Hover-Dachshund, and zoomed after the mystery assassin. / Unfortunately, he had vanished without a trace. / / Defeated, I went back to my office to pour over the K-14 forms. And then, suddenly, there it was - a missing inventory listing for a department of Wattles Tennis Balls Inc., located deep in the bowels of the factory itself. / / It was time I paid a visit to that factory. If there was one thing I was good at, it was poking around in bowels. http://www.goats.com/archive/030526.html

Mothers tell stories of dolphins when they tuck their children in at night. / The fabled animals are said to have frolicked in the same oceans we ourselves crawled out of thousands of years ago. / But even the crackpot scientists who claimed the superintelligent beasts actually existed conceded that they must have been extinct for at least 50 millenia. / So you can imagine my surprise when I found myself face to face with one. http://www.goats.com/archive/030530.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030602.html
You're probably wondering right about now, "Are these the same accountants Rocco Wattles told me about? Is that really a dolphin?" / / "Did Francis Wattles capture one on safari in the darkest jungles of Manhattan many years ago and use hoverdog technology to hook it up to his factory, harnessing its legendary brainpower to run his tennis ball manufacturing equipment?" / / "Am I too late to save the company and the dolphin from their nefarious plot, the details of which are extremely complicated and not worth getting into?" / I'm afraid the answer to all those questions is yes, Mr. Greeley. / Very yes. http://www.goats.com/archive/030602.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030604.html
It's never too late for goodness, you turncoat accountant! / It is when I have a signed and approved schedul 39-B! / / This little piece of paper grants Heartless Bastard Holding Company complete ownership of this tennis ball factory and all the assets contained within, including this suspiciously small and incongruously immortal dolphin. / / So I assume you also have your form HTO-30, which needs to be filed one month in advance of any hostile takeover? / Hot cross buns! I knew I was forgetting something. http://www.goats.com/archive/030604.html

Later... / Well, mister dolphin, you're safe now -- those accountants won't be bothering you anymore, now that their plans have been foiled. But there's still so much I wish I knew. / / Where did you come from? How did you survive all these thousands of years? What did those accountants want with you? I suppose I must take solace in the fact that you'll be cared for and studied by Crab City's best scientists. Farewell, dolphin, farewell. / / NOT THE ARK / DO NOT OPEN / NOT A DOLPHIN / NOT JIMMY HOFFA / Years Later... http://www.goats.com/archive/030606.html

Lori, you skanky bitch. / Hello, Greta. What brings you skulking back here after all these years? / / I heard you were a zombie. So tacky. So trailer park. / This from a woman who has never seen a bar of soap. / / Oh, don't get huffy, my little American imperialist. I am just playing. / Move your hand or I add it to my extensive collection. http://www.goats.com/archive/030625.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030627.html
Do you think Tommy would hire me back? The place certainly could use some class. / I don't think we're gunning for the Euro-trash vibe. / / Just for a short while. I do not intend to stay in this cesspool for long. / Just long enough to sleep with all the friendly neighborhood heroin addicts? / / Speaking of, how is your old boyfriend? Does he still scream my name? / Yeah. Yours and Rin Tin Tin's. http://www.goats.com/archive/030627.html

I am sorry to hear that Carl left you. He was an excellent lover. / I don't need him. Or anyone. / / Nonsense. We will get you a man. How about that cutie over there? / You've picked yet another winner. / / Wha... Why am I getting zits on my arms? / Maybe they are eating chocolate while you are asleep. http://www.goats.com/archive/030630.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030702.html
Well, if you're not going to take him, then I will. / He's all yours. Enjoy. / / I will get that Jew so hot he will think he is in an Auschwitz crematorium. / Glad to hear it. / / You're no fun. What happened to my favorite jealous, territorial neocolonialist? / Let's keep my colon out of this. http://www.goats.com/archive/030702.html

Tales of Horror for the religious right. / Once upon a time, the supreme court justices of a country in a far away land got really loaded. They stood up and said, "Let there be sodomy for everyone!" and the children did rejoice. / / But then, Freddie Mercury came back to life! Thirty feet tall! Dressed only in a loincloth, covered in sequins the size of hubcaps! And, with the help of the Village People, he formed the SODOMY SQUAD. / For a thousand dark years, no hole would go unsodomized. / / Stop that. We're in the middle of a storyline. / The people have spoken, Jon, and they love sodomy. http://www.goats.com/archive/030704.html

Excuse me, do you live around here often? Because you put the marshmallows in my Lucky Charms. / What? / / I see you are not the type for pickup lines and small talk. You are a man of action! And I... I am Greta. / I can see that. / / You will meet me here at eight this evening for a rousing bout of hot buttered laps. Do not make me wait. / Oh my. / Yes ma'am. http://www.goats.com/archive/030707.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030709.html
Hot buttered laps! Did you hear that? S-She wants to do hot buttered laps! / But what about the pretty lady that gives you kisses? / / Megan. Gah. I know, but... I have never had a woman like... like that offer to do hot buttered laps with me. Never. / It sounds sticky. / / This would be so much easier if I knew what hot buttered laps was. / I wish I had a lap. http://www.goats.com/archive/030709.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030711.html
So I see you've met Greta, then? / You know her? / / She used to be a bartender here. She was fired just before you and the rest of the dork squad infested the place. / Fired? For what? / / I was never entirely sure. Something to do with her thighs, a customer's head and an ocelot. / Was butter involved? http://www.goats.com/archive/030711.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030714.html
So you're the next notch on Greta's bedpost, eh? / I.... I can't. I want to, but I could never do that to my girlfriend. / / You're going to pass up a night with the woman who invented the inverse flying camel for a pine cone with googly eyes pasted to it? / I stopped dating the pine cone. This is a real woman. / / You mean with legs and everything? / Limbs, head, the works. I know, I'm surprised myself. http://www.goats.com/archive/030714.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030716.html
So you're not going to sleep with Greta. Wow. You know, it's really a shame you turned out to have ethics. / Oh? Why's that? / / 'Cause I would have joined in. http://www.goats.com/archive/030716.html

Knock Knock / Hold on. I'm coming. / / Damned kids. Where'd they go? / Down here, Lady. / / Please pick me up! A big dog scared me with barking. http://www.goats.com/archive/030718.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030721.html
So I was at the bar and I was talking to the man with the big hair and he was eating chocolate with his arms and then there was something about butter and laps and it might have been something about the lady with the dangerous shoulders but I don't remember too well. / / But then the lady went away and the man was upset about butter and then a different lady came by and then she was kissing the man and it made me feel bad like the time I stole candy from the tray by the cash register at the diner so I came straight here to tell you. Can I have a hug? / / If I understand you correctly, which would be miraculous, I'm going to rip someone's instestines out through their nostril. / Please not me, lady! I need my inestines! http://www.goats.com/archive/030721.html

Hey honey, I'm home! You're not going to believe what happened today...Megan? / / Baby pie? You home? Hello? Hell...oh. / / dear jon, / god, I hate myself for writing those words. but I'm none too please with you either, you cheating scum. if you want to be with her, fine. I won't stand in your way. / -megan / / p.s. -- please don't forget to floss. bastard. http://www.goats.com/archive/030725.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030728.html
Megan! What's wrong? / I've left Jon. He cheated on me. / / I know he's your friend, and normally I wouldn't bother you, but I'm a long way from home, I'm unemployed and I don't have anyone else in New York to turn to. Would you mind if I stayed here for a bit until I can get my act together? / / If you've got a spare kidney, we've got a spare room. / It's a good thing I know you're kidding. I only have enough murderous rage for one person right now. http://www.goats.com/archive/030728.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030730.html
She's gone! Megan is gone! Gone gone gone! / Whoa, there, mister. Your needle is skipping. / / I'm going to die of cranial implosion if I don't find out where she is. / She's staying at our place. I just got off the phone with Lauren. / / She says you should keep your distance until Megan calms down if you want to salvage your friendship. / Friends?! She said friends?! That word is a killing word. http://www.goats.com/archive/030730.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030801.html
I've got to talk to her, Phillip. / I've been told in no uncertain terms that you'll lose your secondary sex characteristics if you go within a hundred feet of Megan. / / She's got to listen to reason. / Ah, see, there's your error. Logic doesn't work on women. It only fuels their rage, like Vulcan vampires. / / But this isn't my fault! / Actually, would Vulcan vampires even feel rage? That doesn't sound right. http://www.goats.com/archive/030801.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030804.html
I've got to get Megan back. There's no point to living without her. / Other people don't give you purpose, Jon. You have to give it to yourself. / / Spare me your existentialism, Toothgnip. / You want her back? Well, a woman wants a man who can define his own special purpose. Dependence is unattractive. / / Fine. My special purpose is to destroy Phobos. / Well, I applaud you for shooting high. http://www.goats.com/archive/030804.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030806.html
If I'm going to destroy Phobos, I'm going to need approximately forty billion dollars and a large ball of twine. / Ahem. / Tap tap / / Yes, o great sage? / I'm getting a sort of a Jodie Foster/John Hinckley Jr. vibe here. Are you doing this to impress Megan, or for yourself? / / So you're saying it's okay to gratuitously annihilate entire worlds, but only if I do it for the right reasons? / Now you got it. http://www.goats.com/archive/030806.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030808.html
I need your help with a project I think you'd be uniquely suited to. / Sorry, I've got my hands full helping out with the California governor's race. / / It's good to see you getting involved in civics, Diablo. Which campaign are you working on? / Republicans for Voldemort. / / They realy will let anyone run, won't they? / I find it refreshing that there's finally a candidate without a hidden agenda. http://www.goats.com/archive/030808.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030811.html
Megan, if you're going to be staying with us, I think we should establish some ground rules. / Okay. Shoot. / / First off, I want to make it absolutely clear that there will be no squirrel breeding inside this apartment. That includes both traditional and genetic manipulation varieties. I don't see any need for that sort of thing. / / I think I should be able to handle that one. / Squirrels make me angry. So very angry http://www.goats.com/archive/030811.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030813.html
VERY LATER / ...furthermore, there will be no local violation of general relativity, unless you are having a romantic liason with some sort of, I dunno, omnipotent transquantum entity. Yes. / / I appreciate all this, but I really do have to get back to my job search. / Fine. Don't blame me when Oolong the Perky tries to impregnate you with his demon-seed. / / I have to get out of here. / Omigod! We could go to Denny's! I have a coupon. http://www.goats.com/archive/030813.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030818.html
Hot-Dog-On-A-Stick. How may I direct your call? / I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number. I thought this was Soylent Consulting. / / Oh, that's us! Soylent was bought out of bankruptcy by their competitor Webnuts L.L.C., which was acquired by G.S.R.C. (Giant Scandal-Ridden Corp.), which was absorbed by Hot-Dog-On-A-Stick, the world's most usable hot dog. / / I have to beg for a job with Hot-Dog-On-A-Stick? / I'm sorry, but we're not accepting applications at this time. http://www.goats.com/archive/030818.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030820.html
Arnaud? Hey, it's Megan! Yeah, from Soylent. I was wondering what you and Mike were up to these days. / / Really? Your own firm? Listen, you guys need any help? I'll do just about anything for a steady paycheck. / / / No, not that. No. Tell Mike to put it away. And the puppets too. Okay, just this once. http://www.goats.com/archive/030820.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030822.html
Wow, Arnaud! Nice office you got here! / No time for pleasantries. We've got a pitch to a client in....twelve hours. / / No sweat. We did eight hours once, remember? / But this time we're bidding against Hot-Dog-On-A-Stick. / / Ooh. Scary. / Hot-Dog-On-A-Stick killed my parents. http://www.goats.com/archive/030822.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030825.html
Mike, it's been far too long. How goes it? / Oh, you know me, still the same old carefree "I'll do anything for a buck" fun-guy hipster. / / Since I left Soylent, I've been working on some personal projects. This summer we found a subculture of mole people in some abandoned subway tunnels that were really into the speed-quilting scene. I started an e-commerce site specializing in infrared hornrimmed glasses and phosphorescent yarn. / / Speed-Quilting? / Yeah, apparently it gets really, really boring down there. http://www.goats.com/archive/030825.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030827.html
So what's the project? / The client wants a value-driven inventory tracking and scalable e-consolidation portal with real-time supply-chain optimization featuring cross-channel integration with legacy stuff. / / / Do you even know what that is? / No, but neither does the client. / I think we should make it bright orange. http://www.goats.com/archive/030827.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030829.html
...and the site nav is self-configuring, so maintenance should be a breeze. / That's all good and fine, but what we really need is a snappy name for it. / / I've got it. How about the "Relational Asset Tracking Goal-Oriented Network And Database"? / / You want to call it R.A.T.-G.O.N.A.D.? / Well, it's undeniably memorable. / And the domain name is available too. http://www.goats.com/archive/030829.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030901.html
So that's the last of it. I think we're ready. / Good, because the client will be here in about ten minutes. / / Who is the client, anyway? / Looks like they're a bit early. / / A Mister Dispater here to see you, sir. / If they're not ready for us, I can just read a magazine. http://www.goats.com/archive/030901.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030903.html
Well, what can I say? This is just fabulous. Exactly what we need to manage our...inventory. And I adore this shade of orange. / / I'm glad you like it. / Of course, we're going to have to pay you in human souls. / / This is worse than working for Fox News. / I'm just pulling your leg. I have a corporate Amex. http://www.goats.com/archive/030903.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030905.html
The next project I want to work on is a biggie. As you might guess, the sixth level has a bit of a poor reputation as a vacation spot. We're looking to bring in more tourists. Families, if possible. / / You want us to do an online ad campaign promoting hell as an alternative to Disneyworld? / Personally, I think we have better rides. / / "Hell: it's not just painful disembowelments by a Taco-Spork-wielding-madman for all eternity anymore!" / I'd go a bit less wordy. http://www.goats.com/archive/030905.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030908.html
Arnaud, I'm not entirely comfortable with this client. / Oh, c'mon. It's gonna be great. We've got Slobodan Milosevic doing endorsements. / / And that's supposed to make me feel good about it. / I mean, I was hoping for Hitler. He's got better name recognition in our target demographic. But this is okay. / / You're not getting this at all, are you? / I hear Hitler's difficult to work with anyway. http://www.goats.com/archive/030908.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030910.html
I'm serious, Arnaud. I'm not religious, but this does seem like one of those instances where a bit of caution would be wise. / / No, it's okay, I get you. No need for you work on this project. I have a new production team starting today, and I can put them on it instead. / / You're hiring more people? Who are they? / Oh, I think you'll be meeting them shortly. http://www.goats.com/archive/030910.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030912.html
What part of "I never want to see you again" do you find confusing? / It's good to see you too. / / You're quitting. Today. / No, I think it's going to be much easier to stalk you if I'm in the same office. / / And what's your excuse, traitorous lobotomite? / Don't mind me. I'm just here for the schadenfreude. http://www.goats.com/archive/030912.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030915.html
Have you seen Squeaky McGee around? / Who is Squeaky McGee? / / You don't remember him? Oh my. He's probably been erased from the space-time continuum due to some sort of temporal accident. / Oh no! / / It's a shame really. You two shared some special moments. / I miss Squeaky so much. http://www.goats.com/archive/030915.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030917.html
C'mon. It's time to settle up. / Can you cover me? I'm a bit short on cash. / / Let me guess. Your cat died. Again. / Do you have any idea how expensive these things are to replace? / / Maybe you should poke some little air holes through the bandages. / Hey, I'm a busy guy. I don't have time for arts and crafts. http://www.goats.com/archive/030917.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030919.html
C'mon, Megan, it wasn't even my fault. Lori forced herself on me. / It's not about the kiss, Jon. It's the choices you've made. / / I've had some time to consider this, and it's become clear that you're far too immature to ever have a real-world relationship with anyone. You chose to spend your life in a bar, ogling some white trash slut, safe in your teenage fantasies. Now it's my turn to choose. And I choose to wash my hands of all of this. / / Good-bye, Jon / Well, now I choose you! / I choose you, pikachu! http://www.goats.com/archive/030919.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030924.html
Well hello there, Mister. Back for more sugar? / Are you joking? Megan broke up with me because of your little stunt. / / Then a bit of horizontal action can't make matters much worse. Unless you think there's a chance you could get her back. You know, that's quite the dilemma you've got there. / / Get out of my mind, Bene Gesserit Witch! / Pet names already? That's so precious. I'm going to call you "snookums". http://www.goats.com/archive/030924.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/030926.html
Get your hands off me. / Fine. Your loss. I won't lose any sleep over it. / / But the thing that's going to keep you up at night is trying to decide if I was simply sabotaging your relationship for kicks, or if I really wanted you. / / No, I think I'll sleep quite well tonight. http://www.goats.com/archive/030926.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/030929.html
Jon? / / Jon, what are you doing? / / Megan!? / squik / / Oh no. http://www.goats.com/archive/030929.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/031001.html
Fish, I am so sorry. / What for? / / I like totally killed you. / I don't think so. I feel pretty good, like a carousel pony. / / You have a spike in your chest. / I have a body piercing now! Does that mean I'm cool? http://www.goats.com/archive/031001.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/031003.html
So you're saying Fish is immortal. / Musta been that zombie goop we fed him. / / He can't be invulnerable. What if he was eaten by a cat? / Well, yes, then he'd be a snack. At which point the cat itself would most likely become immortal. http://www.goats.com/archive/031003.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/031006.html
I am Space Mummy. I am going to take your fish. / Okay. / / You can't let him take Fish! / Why? Do you think he's the bad type of Space Mummy? / / Of course not. I'm sure he's a humanitarian Space Mummy. / That's good. Because he's really big and scary. http://www.goats.com/archive/031006.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/031008.html
Time to make another choice, Jon. / One step ahead of you. HEY! Mr. Space Mummy! / / Speak. / I'll give you THIRTY BUCKS to let the fish go. / / Jon! / Okay, forty! But I'm gonna have to borrow back subway fare from you. http://www.goats.com/archive/031008.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/031010.html
Insolent worm. I will take your woman as well. She will be sold to the sentient flatulence worms of Bortox Seven for use as live bait. / / Well, this couldn't get any worse. / Sure it could. / / Who wants some coffee!? http://www.goats.com/archive/031010.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/031013.html
We used to hang out, man. We used to be TIGHT. / It's not my fault, Frank! I swear! / / Then whose fault is it? / Its, uh, the Space Mummy's fault. Yes. / / Him? What'd he do? / Stuff. Lots of stuff. Kill him now, please. http://www.goats.com/archive/031013.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/031015.html
Alright, buddy, tea time is over. / / / Be quiet. http://www.goats.com/archive/031015.html

Koff Koff / / You've won this round. But you haven't seen the last of SPACE MUMMY. / / Mummy - B - Gon / 98% guaranteed mummy removal spray http://www.goats.com/archive/031017.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/031020.html
Since when do you carry a can of anti-mummy spray? / Did you know this stuff's main ingredient is chili dogs? / / Jon / It's Phillip's. He left it in the bathroom when he moved out, and I'm just getting around to returning it to him. / / Phillip keeps mummy spray in the bathroom? / I think he likes the little picture of Heather Locklear on the side. http://www.goats.com/archive/031020.html

I gotta admit you really came through, Jonny. Color me impressed. / Thanks. Listen, Megan, I have something I think I need to say. / / What you said to me earlier was a wakeup call. I need to rededicate myself and turn things around. I think I can do it with your help. Megan, will you marry me? / / Oh. Jon, I'm so sorry, but no. http://www.goats.com/archive/031022.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/031024.html
No? No? Megan, no? Did you say no? / I still don't know if I can trust you, Jon. / / I saved you from a freaking Space Mummy, Megan. / And that's super. But it's not enough. / / I destroyed Phobos for you, too. / Well, maybe something can be worked out. http://www.goats.com/archive/031024.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/031027.html
I won't marry you, but I am willing to give you another chance. / So, wait. Are we still living together? / / Yes. / Are we having sex on a regular basis? / / Sure. / So what's the difference? / / I'm not your girlfriend--we're just dating. / Again, what's the difference? / / You have to take me out for nice dinners. / fin. http://www.goats.com/archive/031027.html

What the hell is on your t-shirt? / It's a pirate monkey robot. I bought it from some webcomic. / / What does that have to do with the webcomic? / Dunno. Maybe it mentioned monkeys once. / / And why exactly did you buy this monkey shirt? / Lack of free will? http://www.goats.com/archive/031029.html

Hitler's Internet Musings / Friday, October 31st, 2003 / 10:13 am - Happy Halloween! / I don't know about you guys, but I am so psyched for Himmler's costume party tonight. He said they're probably getting a keg and they might be able to get some Triple Sec too, which is my absolute fave. Eichman is going to be there -- I think he might have a crush on me. / / We're going to see Scary Movie 3 next weekend. I'll let you know what happens! / / I have to say I'm a little disappointed with the new Radiohead album. I just don't get it. I think maybe they've lost their golden touch. / Anyway, not much else going on today. / Here's a naughty picture of me! / Peace out, Hitler / / I really didn't need to see Hitler's nipple today. / I think I'm going to buy him something off his wishlist. http://www.goats.com/archive/031031.html

Rich. Hi, Rich. / Howdy Rich. / She's not my responsibility. / / It's time to repay us for saving your collective butt during WWII. / Or we'll kick you repeatedly. / Castration won't compare to what Holly will do. / / All right. If you help us get rid of her, we'll give you a change of clothes. / Oh, bless you both. Let's get down to business. http://www.goats.com/archive/020218.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020219.html
Okay, I've got it... first, we drop a cow on her. / It's been done. / Slipping her a few drinks is sounding so much wiser now. / / I'm not sure how getting the cow drunk is going to help any. / Perhaps he plans to set the alcohol-soaked cow on fire. / Fifteen snakebite and black. / / Same for me, thanks. / He's fundamentally imbalanced, you know. / Did someone mention flaming cows? http://www.goats.com/archive/020219.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020220.html
You're right, Holly. Megan is nothing compared to you. / I thought you'd come around eventually, mister. / / To celebrate my new-found clarity, I thought we might enjoy several pints of Snakebite and Black. / Open bars certainly bring out the big spender in you. / / I think this is the world's fist documented case of a man trying to get a woman drunk so as to not have to sleep with her. / It's the end of an era. http://www.goats.com/archive/020220.html

C'mon, Jonathan, up with you. I came all this way on a cross-atlantic flight, nary a honey-roasted peanut in sight, and now i expect to be serviced. / Blerg. / / You're useless, Jonny.

Frosted / I don't know how it happened, Diablo, but I've fallen for Suzie. / Suzie? Really? / / Frosted / Things were going great until I invited her to the wedding. And then, she just disappeared.

This is Arthur. He's a psychologist who lives down the hall. / Hi. / Are you the best Arthur?

So that's it? You're just going to forget about Suzie? / No, man she's the love of my life. / / So what are you going to do? / I'm going to bury my feelings deep inside, where they will fuel my womanizing and boorish behavior. / / I'm so proud of you. / I've already got a nice ulcer going. http://www.goats.com/archive/020508.html

Oh my god. I just found out that Ric Ocasek and Paulina Porizkova live down the block from us.

So these neighbors of yours are famous? / Yeah. When I was in junior high, I used to have dreams where Paulina was the captain of the Enterprise. / / I thought she was a model.

Operation "Gettin' It On" is a complete failure. / Your goatee didn't melt the icy heart of the servant female? / / No. / The human with the unwieldy hair has suggested that there may be a link between fame and sexual appeal amongst humans. / / Then I will become a web-cartoonist! / Oh, sure.

It saves you the hassle of dialing yourself, like those other psychics expect you to. / / You only think you don't need a psychic. I can psychically detect your secret yearning in the hidden, murky and perverted depths of your subconscious. http://www.goats.com/archive/011019.html

I predict that you will soon hear a cow. / Moo. / / No, that was an ethereal spirit cow mooing from beyond the grave. / Spoooooky cow! / / I also predict that tonight's episode of "Titus" will be a rerun. / I am a ruminant! Moo! http://www.goats.com/archive/011022.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011024.html
That spirit cow is calling you, Margaret. Calling you into the new, highly convenient world of central meat for only pennies a day. / / You too can enjoy the benefits of having scads of tasty raw meat pumped directly into your home. / Is she buying it? / / She's calling the cops. / Good. Word-of-mouth is the most effective form of advertising. http://www.goats.com/archive/011024.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011026.html
C'mon, Margie! Are you telling me you don't want me to give you a chance to experience the pure power of meat, 24 hours a day? / / More meat than a little girl like you can handle, i'd warrant more than likely. / Why hasn't she hung up on you yet? / / She says I got it goin' on. / Give me the phone. I need to correct some misconceptions. http://www.goats.com/archive/011026.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011029.html
The woman that was threatening to call the police not five minutes ago? / Margie and I are eloping. / / That was before we discovered our common love of convenience and value. / and what happened last time you rushed into this sort of relationship? / / I know. We all do. / You're right. I... I'm so sorry. I just miss kozmo so much. http://www.goats.com/archive/011029.html

You'll regret buying into all that Harry Potter propaganda when they finally invade and you're knee-deep in wizards. / I'm a meat salesman. / Selling door-to-door meat is difficult. People keep giving me candy and sending me away. / I went through my candy like hot oatmeal through an internally-buttered weasel. / Next year, I say we go as invisible women. / Drunken, invisible women. In Cancun. http://www.goats.com/archive/011031.html

So it looks like Megan is moving in permanently. She's having her stuff shipped from back home. / / Lauren moved in last month after we got engaged. / Any other news you've neglected to mention? / / My socks get crinkly when the sweat dried on them. / Sadly, I already knew that. http://www.goats.com/archive/011102.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011105.html
So Lauren and Phillip got engaged? / Unbelievable, huh? They've moved in together. / / I guess that makes us next, eh? / Megan, they've been dating for, like, 3 billion years. / / If we use your definition of 'year', we've been together for 1.6 billion years. / And they say I can't commit. http://www.goats.com/archive/011105.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011107.html
It's beautiful, Lauren. Congrats. / Thank you! It's so exciting, isn't it? / / So how did you finally get him to pop the question? / Ultimatums. / / Ooh. Good one. Mind if I write that down? / Please do. http://www.goats.com/archive/011107.html

Hey, Jay! Where've you been? / I've gotten engaged, boys! To a lovely woman! / / (Something is wrong here) / Say, You'll have to come out to Jersey some time for a barbecue. / / Oh my lord, he's sober. / We've lost another soul. / Anyone up for a little housewares shopping? http://www.goats.com/archive/011109.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011111.html
Hi. My name is ToothGnip. I'm here to give you respite from this insipid, trite storyline. / / I'm here to give you what you really need: Hot Lovin'. A little bit of chaos. And most importantly, me. / / When you're as big a star as I am, you come to expect that the fans need to be reassured from time to time. So I'm here to stroke your collective thigh. / / And now, I will say something sexy and shocking. Line. / / You said you were supplying your own material. / I don't write my own punchlines. I'm a star dammit. / / Sorry, folks. / Where's my bitches at? http://www.goats.com/archive/011111.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/011112.html
Oh my god, Phillip, what the hell happened to Jay? / Forget about Jay. What if that happens to me. / / You have to break off the engagement. / I'll end up shopping for china patterns at Fortunoff. / / It's strange how I've never really considered dating from an end-game perspective before. / Kill me. http://www.goats.com/archive/011112.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011114.html
So Jay is completely brainwashed? / It's as if his bachelor gene was completely eradicated. / / Hm. This sounds like the work of the Ko-Tex. / The Ko-Tex. / / It's a bit complicated. Let me tell you a little story. / Oh, please don't. / Milk and cookies, please. http://www.goats.com/archive/011114.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011116.html
Months after Shazam Twix defeated Gregor Mendel in the head-to-head roller biathlon championships, Brussels was still celebrating his victory. Twix owned the heart of the city. / / Lucrative commercial endorsement contracts rolled in. Lockheed martin, Gymboree, Lenny's house of flan, Potato hut... all the big boys wanted Twix to be their pitch-man. / / and companies weren't the only ones that wanted him. Twix was inundated with a flood of adoring females. He was as well laid as Bob Vila's wall to wall shag carpet. http://www.goats.com/archive/011116.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011119.html
Each night, we would leave our flat overlooking the grand-place and strike out for our local haunt, Planet Cocktail Bar, where Twix would procure that evening's sexual conquests. / / Ladies would gather around our table three deep, sucking down mojitos as Twix regaled them with tales of the new branches of hyper-mathematics being invented to calculate his income tax. / / Life was good. We had untold wealth, a team of ninja accountants, and all the flan we could ever desire. But all it took was one woman and her dark secret to bring it all crashing down around us. http://www.goats.com/archive/011119.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011121.html
Late one wednesday evening, Shazam Twix, enjoying the rejuvenating effects of a meal of Kraft dinner (and a side of shelled peanuts - my specialty), remained late at Planet Cocktail bar, seducing co-eds with tales of his hostage regotiations prowess during the second great Albanian crisis. / / As he droned on, my gaze wandered to a dark, sleek woman sitting alone at a table at the far side of the establishment. She turned towards me, and her eyes met mine. She locked her gaze on mine, and I found myself unable to look away. / / As her eyes probed my very soul, my Ka, I felt myself being drawn out of my body and into the brutally cold, infinite space between the fabric, the individual strands, of reality itself. http://www.goats.com/archive/011121.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/011123.html
As my Ka phased back into existence, I found myself inhabiting the body of an old Ukranian woman in 1963 South Carolina. / Oh Boy. / / / Thinking quickly, I flung myself in front of a speeding train... and was returned instantly to my present-time body. / / / A little drastic, eh? / It took that Bakula guy, like five friggin' years. Color me impatient. / Oh boy. http://www.goats.com/archive/011123.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011126.html
I awoke to a dark and deserted Planet Cocktail bar. Twix (and whatever large-breasted, morally ambiguous schoolmarms he had brought to his bed that evening) had clearly left long ago. The mysterious woman with the inconvenient gaze was gone as well. / / Locked in, I made my bed amidst crates of olives and tins of long-abandoned luncheon meat; meat so utterly ancient that no one on staff could remember where it had come from. I waited for the morning, when the bar's owner opened up to serve Eggs 'n' Vodka to kids on their way to school. / / Who was this strange woman who could send a man's soul hurtling into another world? I suspected that to find the answer to that question, I would need to find the woman first. And she was definitely with Twix - she was just his type. And they were definitely at brunch - because people like to eat brunch. http://www.goats.com/archive/011126.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011128.html
I found Twix and the mystery woman right where I had expected -- a sidewalk table at 'Incontinent Freddie's Hedonism Den and Brunchery'. Freddy himself was not in attendance that day as his mere presence tended to have a negative effect on both the hedonism and the brunching. / / He was eating quiche and strawberry pancakes. I had lost him already. / Quiche / / / / They were marking up a Pottery Barn catalogue with highlighters. Twix was going on at length about a pair of velvet throw pillows when he saw me and bade me come join them. If I could not pry him from this harpy's unholy clutches, I would have to kill them both. But first, I would find out who she was and who did her hair. Gorgeous! http://www.goats.com/archive/011128.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011130.html
I walked up to the time-shifting temptress and took the waffle from her breakfast plate, gaining an important tactical advantage and three charisma points. As I'm sure you know, the taking of the waffle is one of the most grievous insults possible in Belgium-land. / / Clearly incensed, she rose from her chair, turned, and then, somehow, she just pushed the world away. Swept it from where we stood. Everything but the two of us disappeared in inky blackness, as though the universe had been temporarily placed in a nearby Tupperware container. / / "Bon jour, fra Diablo. I see that my little diversion has not swayed you from your meddling ways, as it will be each time we meet. You do not know me, yes, but I know you. For I am master of all space and time. I am MENSTRUA, Queen of the Ko-Tex." http://www.goats.com/archive/011130.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011203.html
"I'm sorry to have to run off so quickly," said Menstrua, "but I do have pressing business with your friend Shazam Twix. I'll leave you in the care of my colleages, the Ko-Tex." She disappeared in an extravagant (but tasteful) flash of light. / / / / From out of the shadows of this netherverse crept a swarm of small, bloodthirsty creatures, like drunken maggots crawling from the open sores of some leperous, bloated, half-conscious wino. They were the Ko-Tex -- a race of winged warriors who were as evil as they were absorbent. / / No more metaphors for you, my friend. You've put me off my beer. / What's a metaphor? / For sheep to graze in. http://www.goats.com/archive/011203.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/011205.html
The Ko-Tex were closing in quickly all around me -- there was nowhere to escape to. I had but seconds before they would tear me into nuggets. I shed a single tear, regretting that I had never told Martha how I had truly felt about her. / / Just as I was about to meet my maker, Gloria Steinem broke through the circle of Ko-Tex warriors, torching their cottony, winged bodies with her laser vision. She grabbed my hand and we broke through the membrane of unreality separating the netherverse from our own world, leaving the surviving Ko-Tex behind. / / I asked Gloria back to my place for a celebratory shag, but she declined. "Believe me," she growled, "I'd like nothing better than to show you just what a liberated woman is capable of. But we don't have much time if we want to save your friend from my sister." http://www.goats.com/archive/011205.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011207.html
Gloria told me her story over a shared mayonnaise 'n' peanut butter sandwich. Gloria and Menstrua were fraternal twins (ironice, eh?) raised by a Zen Buddhist enclave of enlightened Teamsters high in the Ural Mountains. / / While they were both infused with the feminist ideal during their childhoods (unions are hotbeds of forward-thinking social reform), Menstrua felt that balance between the sexes could only be achieved by dark means. / / She used her Zen teachings to make contact with a race of transdimensional creatures who would feed off the vital essence of the men she came in contact with. In exchange, they gave her power over the very fabric of space and time. http://www.goats.com/archive/011207.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011210.html
Gloria gave me a Space/Time Distortion Detector, a hickey, and a lucky pair of fuzzy dice. She bade me goodbye. We embraced, and then she was gone as quickly as she came. That was the last time I saw her. But sometimes, when I'm dining at a seafood restaurant, I still think of her shiny, shiny face. / / I used the detector to track Menstrua to her lair, far beneath the lingerie department of Brussel's finest shopping experience, Filene's basement. I should have known I'd find her there, preparing to feed Twix's male essence to her Ko-Tex cronies, all the while getting brand names at wholesale prices. / Bing / Bing / / I found them in the housewares department. Twix was mindlessly dusting the displays in the blinds section, wearing a LaVerne DeFazio sweater, Ko-Tex nipping at his heels. I tried to gouge out my eyes, but it was too late - I would never sleep again. http://www.goats.com/archive/011210.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011212.html
I called out to Twix, hoping to pierce that blank stare and bring him back to his wits. Suddenly, I was barraged by what seemed like thousands of the diminutive, angry transdimensional Ko-Tex. They swarmed from hidden nooks and crannies like anti-butter. I braced myself for the worst. / / / / / / The Ko-Tex made their attack. I was shocked to find myself being horribly, cruelly, gently swabbed by ten thousand cottony-soft teeth attempting to make purchase amongst my feathers and rip out chunks of tender white meat. One got under my wing, and I giggled uncontrollably. / / / / I gathered up the Ko-Tex, one fluffy warrior at a time, until I was holding each and every one of them in my arms. I made my way to the nearest ladies' room, went into the last stall on the right, and flushed the whole mess of 'em. http://www.goats.com/archive/011212.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011214.html
Thousands of flushed Ko-Tex can wreak havoc on a department store's fragile indoor plumbing system. Filene's basement exploded in a torrent of gray water, and Twix and I were washed out into the parking lot along with hundreds of wool scarves and mittens with pictures of dogs on them. / / / / We were mired in an ocean of effluvia. Menstrua was floating above us like whipped cream on hot cocoa. She had escaped the fashion outlet's watery grave with nary a scratch. "Ah, Diablo... I always thought you might find yourself in deep shit someday. BWAHAHA!" / / She actually said 'Bwahaha'? / It could have been a speech impediment. I can't be certain. / I wish I had an evil laugh. http://www.goats.com/archive/011214.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/011217.html
Neck-deep in a very stinky situation, I tried to reason my way out of our predicament. Alluding to our earlier conversation, I explained to Menstrua that since she had foreknowledge of our future encounters, she couldn't possibly kill me. / / Luckily, she agreed. "Yes, Diablo. I'm well aware. We will indeed meet again. But what you may not be aware of is how much you've helped me. Thanks to your ineptitude, you've inadvertently freed me from the cotton-clad grip of the Ko-Tex." / / "We will meet many, many times," she said. "At least three more times, or until the readers start complaining. We may, or may not, play Scrabble during one of those occasions. And if we do, Diablo, I intend to win!" And with that, she disappeared. http://www.goats.com/archive/011217.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011219.html
It was a long time before Twix fully regained his morally flexible aptitude. But that's a tale for another time. / There is a god. / / Do you see, Phillip? The Ko-Tex are out there, Phillip, using alluring women like your girlfriend to drain the lifeforces of good, upstanding bachelors like yourself in exchange for godlike powers over time and space. So go! Go, and confront that thing in your apartment that claims to be human. Drive her out into the void! / / Au bon PAIN!!! / Do you think he took me seriously? / I'm not even sure if he's sentient. http://www.goats.com/archive/011219.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011221.html
You're not possessed by pantyliners from another dimension, are you? / Not last I checked. / / And I don't have to dress like LaVerne DeFazio. / Not unless you really want to. / / Excellent. The wedding will occur as scheduled. / Get your butt to bed, drunken fool. http://www.goats.com/archive/011221.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011223.html
the goats players present: "READERS ASK STUFF" a half-assed production / / / What is Jon and Phil(lip)'s actual profession? / -Julia Kleynbok / I make sure that baked goods stay baked. / And I like pancakes. It doesn't pay much, but I sleep well at night. / / What was the significance of the bean on Diablo's wing? / -Michael McGee / My mother gave it to me on my first birthday, just before she ran off with Russell Crowe. / / How, exactly, does Megan perform the "Leaping Piranha"? / -Leslie Klasterka / Flawlessly. / Shut up. / / Has Toothgnip ever been in love? / -Shreyas Cholia / Only with you, Shreyas. Only with you. / I told him to stop writing. / / Now that jon's life is no longer a pit of misery and despair, what is he doing with all his free time? / -John Fiala / Chinchilla farming is both challenging and emotionally rewarding. / / What does Phillip look like naked? / love, / -ken roberts / Please, don't encourage him. / I don't mind. Really. http://www.goats.com/archive/011223.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011224.html
We're going to K-mart. Wanna come? / There's a K-mart in Manhattan? / / Two, actually. All the cool kids go to the one on Astor. / A K-mart in the city! You know what this means? / / That America is homogenizing into one big redneck Midwestern mall? / It means I can buy toilet paper in bulk again. I'm so jazzed. http://www.goats.com/archive/011224.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/011226.html
I'm going to assign each of you part of the shopping list for maximum K-mart efficiency. / Divide and conquer. Excellent. / / jon, you're in charge of household cleansers and paper goods. Toothgnip will procure fuzzy slippers and Martha Stewart bedsheets. I'll get the industrial adhesives and twine. / What about Phillip? / / I sent Phillip ahead on a fact-finding mission. / I just learned that babies don't like to eat shaving cream. http://www.goats.com/archive/011226.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011228.html
I'd never figure you for the type who'd buy into all this crass commercialism. / There's no better kind. / / You're buying Kathy Ireland-brand stretch pants. Why does a chicken need stretch pants? / They're on sale. / / And that justifies your purchase. / Kathy's dedication to quality is all the justification I need. http://www.goats.com/archive/011228.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/011231.html
You should treat me with more respect. / I can't imagine why. / / Because I might not want to be your pet anymore. / Perdon me whilst I asphyxiate from an endless bout of laughter. / / And people who have pets have been shown to live longer, happier lives. / That's because they always have an emergency food supply. http://www.goats.com/archive/011231.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020102.html
The K-Mart cafe is selling hotdog-like food products for only 50 cents. / Remind me again why we let Diablo drag us here? / / At least he's trying to help. You shouldn't be so hard on him all the time. / Maybe you're right. His intentions are good. / / That terrorist with the tie on is smuggling a pound of plastic explosive in his lower intestine. / Time to go spelunking, Carl. http://www.goats.com/archive/020102.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020104.html
We're going to have to search you, sir. / Search me? Why? / It's for America. Bend over, sir. / / Wow, that looks painful. / Sometimes patriotism means making sacrifices, Phillip. / / And sometimes patriotism means you take it up the ass, apparently. / Our right to shop for housewares in a safe environment outweighs his right to anal sovereignty. This is America, dammit. http://www.goats.com/archive/020104.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/020107.html
I can't make heads or tails of this list. Why the hell do we need so much twine and Elmer's Glue, anyway? / / And how did we end up in the women's clothing section? We were headed for paper goods and incontinence supplies. / / Toothgnip? Toothg... Oh holy crap. http://www.goats.com/archive/020107.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020109.html
Toothgnip... um... What is all this? / I don't know. I was inexorably drawn toward these women's garments and cooking supplies. / / But why? / I... I think I may be a lady, Phillip. / / Well, this explains why my ice cream goes missing at the same time every month. / So I'm going to need more closet space. http://www.goats.com/archive/020109.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020111.html
Let's review the facts. I wear panties. I like silk robes and cookware. I like decorative Hummel figurines. / / So that means you're a woman? / I know. I'm as suprised as you are. / I know. I'm as surprised as you are. / / But you're so smooth with the ladies. / Apparently I'm a raging lesbian. http://www.goats.com/archive/020111.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020114.html
So, that's it. I'm a woman. / Ooh! I'm a woman too! / / Quiet, Chicken. / Why? Why are you the only one around here allowed to have a sexual identity crisis? / / I said shut it, bitch. / I didn't ask for womanhood. Womanhood was thrust upon me. http://www.goats.com/archive/020114.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020116.html
If I'm going to do this woman thing, I've got to learn how to do it properly. / Most women just let Oprah tell them what to think. / / An excellent start. What about food? / Women can eat all they want as long as they complain about it afterwards. / / Fantastic. Now all I need is 30 pairs of painful shoes and some breasts. / And lots of opinions. http://www.goats.com/archive/020116.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/020118.html
Remember to cross your legs when sitting. / And to point out phallic-shaped consumer items as evidence of a secret male conspiracy. / / And you have to wear those absorbent things in your underpants once a month... um... / Llamas. / / You may want independent confirmation on that. / That's it. I'm going to get some real help. / Sadly, Freud is dead this week. http://www.goats.com/archive/020118.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020121.html
Suzie, you gotta help me. I found out I'm actually a woman, and I don't know what to do. / You're not a woman. / / I'm not? / No. You have a penis. / / Oh yeah. / Call me sometime, Toothie. http://www.goats.com/archive/020121.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020123.html
Suzie, if I'm not a woman, then why do I have this uncontrollable desire to dress in women's clothing? / / Well, you spend a lot of time around women. You appreciate our fashion taste. And you know how wonderful the feel of silk on skin can be. It's really not a surprise. / / Got it. Can I go roll around in your clothes hamper? / Sure. Knock yourself out, kid. http://www.goats.com/archive/020123.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020125.html
So it turns out I'm not a woman after all. / Really? / / Nope. I'm just a perverted, crossdressing deviant. / Wow. / / Yeah. You can imagine my relief. / Lauren's too. The size of the bridal party was getting way out of hand. http://www.goats.com/archive/020125.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020127.html
So are you ready? / Well, the band is booked, catering is done, and I've scouted the chapel for places to hide bottles of scotch. So, yeah. / / That's not what I meant. / You mean, am I emotionally ready to commit myself to one woman for the rest of my life? / / Yeah. / You forget, I have no emotions. / / You know that isn't true. / I exhibit carefully orchestrated visceral reactions to external stimuli designed to fool the casual onlooker. / / I'm sure Lauren would be thrilled to hear that. / Oh, I've told her all of this already. / / And she's fine with it? / She appeared upset, but I'm pretty sure it was just a carefully orchestrated visceral reaction. http://www.goats.com/archive/020127.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/020128.html
Shouldn't you be off getting ready for the wedding? / Nah. I still have three units of time. / / Units? / With each unit being defined as one-third of the total amount of time. / / So punctuality isn't much of an issue if your units are arbitrary, huh? / Exactly. And that means I still have time for three more units of beer. http://www.goats.com/archive/020128.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020130.html
Unless something is on fire, I don't want to hear about it. / How many dates can I bring to the wedding? / / None, Toothgnip. It's a small wedding. / Because if I'm limited to one, then Sandra, Bobbi-Ann and Lynette are gonna have a three-way conniption. / / Only people in long-term relationships were invited with dates. / I suppose I could just take Suzie, but I reserve the right to supplemental bridesmaids. http://www.goats.com/archive/020130.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020201.html
So what's this groomsman thing all about? / We stand near the humans while they perform their pair-bonding ceremony. / / Bonding? / I'm not too clear on it either. I think we supply the epoxy. / / I have three gallons of quick-dry resin. / Excellent. The bride has no chance of escape. http://www.goats.com/archive/020201.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020204.html
Want some pre-wedding ice cream? I found that big can of sprinkles you bought home. / Those aren't sprinkles. / / They're not? / Nope. It's kitty litter. / / Oh holy crap, Diablo. Why in Ricardo Montalban's name do you have a giant can of kitty litter? / It tastes good on ice cream. http://www.goats.com/archive/020204.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020206.html
Diablo, can you let Jon know that I've gone to get my hair done for the wedding? I'll meet up with you guys at the cathedral. / / I'm not going to the cathedral. / You're worried that you might be struck down by God for your Satan-Worshipping shtick? / / Nuh-uh. Sitting in those hard, wooden pews makes my butt fall asleep. / Well, the lord works in mysterious ways. http://www.goats.com/archive/020206.html

Where's Megan? We have to get to the wedding. / She was kidnapped by manic-depressive wolverines. / / Knock Knock / Did you lock her out of the apartment again? / No. The wolverines must have forgotten something. / / Gah! / Quick, throw these steaks out the door!

Holly? Holly, don't get me wrong, it's terribly nice to see you, and please don't mind the livestock, but what the hell are you doing here? / / I'm here for the wedding, silly. And for you, of course. Be sure to bring your dancing shoes and your libido. See you there, Jonny. / / That was cruel, but I can't deny that you've got it down to an art. / I used to practice on the sherpas. / Gah. http://www.goats.com/archive/020211.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020212.html
Phillip, explain to me why Holly West just appeared at my door on her way to your wedding? / Your imaginary ex-girlfriend? / / Phillp, you've met her! What were you thinking, inviting her? / You know better than to expect an actual thought process to take place. / / You don't think this might cause just a bit of a problem with my current girlfriend? / Sheesh. Next thing, you'll be yelling at me for inviting Lori. http://www.goats.com/archive/020212.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020213.html
This is terrible. There's no way I can resist Holly's advances. She's a force of nature. / Like thunder. or earthquakes. or a really high pollen count. / / Megan and Holly are both going to be at the wedding. I'm screwed. / You go off to the ceremony. Leave Megan to me... I'll find a way to detain her. / / Later... / I'm off to meet Jon at the wedding / Have fun. http://www.goats.com/archive/020213.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/020214.html
Phillip, it's worse than I could possibly have imagined. Holly's gone bad! / Nonsense. She's a lovely girl. / / Fetch me a vodka and tonic, boy, or I'll set your trousers on fire. / Eep. / / Still, there's something intriguing about her in a sexy, train-wreck sort of fashion. / Too bad Megan is coming. / It's a shame, really. http://www.goats.com/archive/020214.html

You guys ever think about teaming up? Planning something unspeakably evil? / Like what? / / Like the Llamadome!!! It's the latest + greatest in international extreme llama combat. Two llamas enter, one llama leaves! / / Eh? / I'm not clear on what happens to the non-leaving llama. / Perhaps it leaves later with some lovely parting gifts. http://www.goats.com/archive/010530.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010601.html
While I think the llama-dome would be entertaining, I'm not sure how it contributes to overall evil growth. What if we started an evil organization under the guise of a legitimate business? / / Like a registration drive for republicans. / Or we could be ghostwriters for wrestling autobiographies. / / I think those might blow our cover a bit too quickly. / We could start an erotic bakery. We could sell life-sized bread "companions". http://www.goats.com/archive/010601.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010604.html
I have an idea!! We could start an army of vicious sea monkeys!! And we can use them to attack France! And other countries!! / / We'd have to negotiate with the sea monkey king and queen to forge an alliance. / Sea monkeys aren't an advanced enough species to warrant a king or queen. / / But they're depicted with crowns on the packaging. / How would sea monkeys make crowns, anyway? / Do sea monkeys smelt? http://www.goats.com/archive/010604.html

How about an ice cream company that sells evil flavors? / What sort of flavors? / / Like, say, "Schrodinger's Swirl".

Fish obey my every command! Fishmaster will destroy you! / I don't get it..what do you want? / / Forget it.

Look, I can understand watching children's T.V. occasionally. But Mr. Rogers? / He's a cultural touchstone, Toothgnip... / / Mr. Rogers could explain shoe-tying and make it seem like the coolest thing in the world. He was our uncle and older brother. He told us we were special, and we knew he'd be there for us. / / So he was basically a cult leader. / Right down to the sneakers. http://www.goats.com/archive/010613.html

Things are actually pretty good, Dave. I'm dating a wonderful girl. / Do I know her? / / Probably not. Her name is Megan. / Megan Rutowski? The one that wears thong underwear? / / For your sake, you'd better be psychic or armed. / Does she still do that "Leaping Piranha" thing? http://www.goats.com/archive/010625.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010627.html
How do you know Megan?? / In the modern or Biblical sense? / / Both. / We were in some classes together in college, and we would occasionally sleep with each other. For kicks. / / How could you do this to me, Dave? / Technically, you weren't the one I was doing things to. http://www.goats.com/archive/010627.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010629.html
Look, I apologize for not anticipating that you might one day have a relationship with someone that I slept with. / / From now on, I'll consult with you before I pump anyone full of my hot, throbbing manhood. / Okay, I get the point. / / Excuse me, I'd love to penetrate both of you repeatedly, but my friend here has called 'dibs.' / Alright already! http://www.goats.com/archive/010629.html

Slut. / Bless you. / / I didn't sneeze. / True. But you're going to need all the help you can get after I beat the snot out of you. http://www.goats.com/archive/010702.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010704.html
You! You you you slept with David!! / Oh, yeah...man, David was a dirty boy. / / I can't believe you would do this to me. / It was seven years ago, Jon. It's really none of your business. / / Try explaining that to my brain, which is currently on fire. / The real irony is that you introduced us. http://www.goats.com/archive/010704.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010706.html
Wait...I introduced you to Dave? / Yes. At one of your fraternity parties. / / This is one of those memories that got wiped out in a frenzy of bong hits, right? / Is there any other kind? / / I was in a fraternity? I'm so embarrassed. / You should be. And it gets worse. http://www.goats.com/archive/010706.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010709.html
It was the spring of 1994. Quentin Tarantino was still hip, Boyz II Men desperately wanted to make love to you, we had been on three dates. And you, Jon, predicted that the web would never take off, since Gopher was "a zillion times faster." / / You were a Bio major, at the head of your class. / / Your studies kept you busy for much of your time. / She was...an American girl! http://www.goats.com/archive/010709.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010711.html
Your fraternity held it's Annual Vomit-Till-You-Puke Beerfest that Spring. / ...and we'll be spending all your dues to turn the downstairs bar into a giant conch shell for the party. / Point of order. / / The Chair recognizes Mr. Hudes. / You're an idiot, and you're stupid too. / / Will the Sergeant-at-Arms please stab Mr. Hudes. / Please step off the carpet. http://www.goats.com/archive/010711.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/010713.html
Jon, you're going to have to clear out your room for the party. / We're having a party? / / Your room is designated for keg stands and general debauchery. We'll need the space emptied. / This is my room? / / Well, it's where you've been passing out, which is close enough. / What is this? Sanskrit? http://www.goats.com/archive/010713.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010716.html
Meanwhile, over at the Chi Chi Chi sorority house, we were readying ourselves for the party. / This bra is far too difficult to remove. / Anyone up for a pillow-fight? / I get drunk after only one wine cooler! / I hope I get to sleep with a Bio major! / / Are you sure we went to the same school? / It's my story. I'm allowed a bit of artistic license. http://www.goats.com/archive/010716.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010718.html
And do, the party began. / Dave, if you see Megan, bring her to the front of the line. / Depends. What does she look like? / / Blonde and perky. / And she's here to see you?! Do I get a taste? / / Not if you want that video of you in those assless chaps to remain a secret. / Secret? I'm looking for a distributor for it. http://www.goats.com/archive/010718.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010720.html
I can't wait to introduce you to jon, but I'm not terribly eager to cram myself inside a crowded frat house. / Where's the worm? / / He's not a worm. He's a very nice boy. / There's supposed to be a worm at the bottom of the boggle. Bottle. / / You're drinking Boone's Farm, Celia. / Oh, wasn't Boggle just the best game ever? http://www.goats.com/archive/010720.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010722.html
jon was just here looking for you. / Can you talk to him over that thing? / My back teeth are floating. / / No, but I can put in a call for him if you want to wait here. / That would be great. / Is there a bathroom in there? / / Upstairs, on the right. / Thanks! / / / / / Oh. / Excuse me, ma'am. http://www.goats.com/archive/010722.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/010723.html
Oh, I'm so sorry, I... / Oh, it's my fault, I'm so... http://www.goats.com/archive/010723.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010725.html
Someone's spotted Jon. / Yay! Is he on his way out? / / He's getting busy with someone in one of the upstairs bathrooms. / Oh. / / So, um... wanna screw? / Sure, why not. http://www.goats.com/archive/010725.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010727.html
...and that's why women go to the bathroom in pairs. / I would never do that to you. I don't believe it. / / No, you wouldn't now, but back then... well, there were alot of intoxicants involved. / It would take more than that. / No, you wouldn't now, but back then... well, there were a lot of intoxicants involved. / / I suspect that her naked ass on your naked crotch probably had something to do with it. / Okay, you got me there. http://www.goats.com/archive/010727.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010730.html
That was a terrible movie, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. / I understand how the humans and apes got on the planet, but where did the horses come from? / / Doesn't every space station have horses on it? / It WOULD be the most efficient way of getting around the station. / / Maybe where the proper conditions exist, horses must evolve. / Horses as a universal constant. I like it. http://www.goats.com/archive/010730.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010801.html
Tim Burton is an infallible god. There cannot be any plot holes in his movies. / But there CAN be thousands of civilizations of intelligent horses scattered about the galaxy. / / It's the more likely explanation. / If there aren't any plot holes, why did the chimp in the space-pod have a gun? / / Simple. If he's captured by horses, he needs a way to commit suicide. / Intriguing. Burton's thought all of this out very carefully. http://www.goats.com/archive/010801.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/010803.html
So you can't accept the sudden and unexplained appearance of horses on a distant world. / Correct. / Correct. / / Correct. / Correct. / But you have no problem accepting that said world is ruled by intelligent talking animals. / / It's funny how selective suspension of disbelief mimics early-onset senility. / I'm not senile. I'm a fanboy. / Irony: nature's candy. http://www.goats.com/archive/010803.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010806.html
Wanna be my demon bride? / Dunno. Whats I gotta do? / / Nothing too drastic. A few ritual slayings, human sacrifices, the occasional dinner party. / What car you drive? / / I'm saving up for a tricycle. / My man gots to have him a Corvette. http://www.goats.com/archive/010806.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010808.html
How do you do it, Toothie? What makes you so smooth with the ladies? / I eat a lot of paella. / / C'mon, I'm your friend. Tell me. / Actually, I harbor an intense distaste for you. / / I'll just make this check out to 'cash.' / I'll need two forms of picture I.D. http://www.goats.com/archive/010808.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010810.html
Making yourself appealing to a woman doesn't take place in a dingy bar or expensive restaurant. It takes place in her head. The first thing you need to do is create an external mental persona. / / And how does one do that? / I have a trick I use: While you're talking to her, imagine you're telepathically placing dirty thoughts in her head. / / Like when khan used the CETI eel to place hypnotic suggestions in Chekov's addled brain. / The second thing you need to do is spend less time with Phillip. http://www.goats.com/archive/010810.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010813.html
You're not really putting any thoughts in her head, per se. The 'trick' allows you to relax, to control the situation. You'll begin to exude confidence. / / Confidence. / Women dig confidence like Robert Downey Jr. digs the crack pipe. They can't get enough of it. Confidence is very sexy. / / So I get confidence by... um... giving crack to Robert Downey Jr. / That's not the most efficient method, no. http://www.goats.com/archive/010813.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/010815.html
Confidence signals to a woman that you've got something in your life that makes you happy... that whatever assets you may have make your risk tolerance so high that you need not worry for anything. Confidence is security. / / If you really want to achieve a degree of confidence that won't trigger anyone's bullshit detectors, the best and only way is to go out and improve your station in life until you're happy. / / But if I achieve happiness, why do I need a woman? / I have underestimated you, Grasshopper. http://www.goats.com/archive/010815.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010817.html
And finally, if you do decide to look for a mate, never go after a homely woman. Homely women hate themselves and will assume something is wrong with you if you associate with them. / / Hot women hate themselves too, but their own recognition of their innate hotness causes a weird sort of cognitive dissonance, leaving them confused and stupid and vulnerable to suggestion. / / So, what if I just want lots and lots of sex? / Panties of Potency, my friend. http://www.goats.com/archive/010817.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010819.html
i really shouldn't do this. / c'mon, big boy. i want 2 take n astroglide shower with u. / / my girlfriend will be home any minute. / put ur hand on mi chest / / ok. / ur hand is so warm on my nipples. / / um, that's.... nice. / o how your sexytalk turns me on / / now put ur hand on mi p-nis / your WHAT? / / Now reveal to him that you're a buffalo. / He's gonna hemorrhage when we email the chat logs to his mom. http://www.goats.com/archive/010819.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010820.html
Me? But I'm the last delivery person left on staff. / I'm sorry, Megan, but we're going to have to let you go. / / And you still have twelve project managers. / Soylent needs a strong leadership. / / And who's going to produce deliverables? My ficus? / You know, if you weren't always raising these sorts of issues, you might still have a job here. http://www.goats.com/archive/010820.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010822.html
I should have seen this coming. It's entirely my fault. / You should probably have sent out some resumes when the layoffs began. / / Five days severance. I gave those people the best years of my life, dammit. / You were there for six months. / / Unsupportive boyfriends sleep on the couch. / You gave those people the best years of your life, dammit. http://www.goats.com/archive/010822.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/010824.html
Megan... I heard about your situation. I may be able to help you. / / Help me? How? / / Well, let's just say that I know certain people with certain talents who might be able to liberate certain assets from a certain company. / / This sounds like a very bad idea. / Don't worry. He's quite competent. http://www.goats.com/archive/010824.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010827.html
Phillip, you can't just steal my paycheck from my former employer. It's illegal. / Illegality is only a consideration if you have a chance of getting caught. / / Okay, then, it's immoral. / Which is only a consideration if you adhere to a code of ethics. / / Ethics are rather inconvenient... / Cognitive dissonance reduces my productivity. http://www.goats.com/archive/010827.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010829.html
What's he doing now? / Spoofing their security provider's bot to gain access to the maintenance port. / / It looks like he's surfing movie news web sites. / The two activities are similar in appearance. / / Die Die Die / Is he in? / No, but apparently James Spader + Andrew McCarthy have wonderful chemistry in the upcoming sci-fi comedy "Quirky White Guys." http://www.goats.com/archive/010829.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010831.html
Die Die Fornicate 666 / No, just funnel off the half-cents left over from the interest compounding. / / Why does he talk like that? / He distills the essence of human thought into the three eternal concepts of death, sexuality, and evil. / / I never would have guessed. / Or maybe it's because I kick him in the head a lot. http://www.goats.com/archive/010831.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010903.html
There's been a security breach? / Someone's trying to access the MCP, sir. / / Well, just use the laser to scan him into the system. We'll put him on the game grid. / You can't do that in real life, sir. / / You computer types aren't good for anything, are you? / I'll dispatch a hospitality squad, sir. http://www.goats.com/archive/010903.html

Who the hell rang the doorbell? / Down here. We're corporate mercenaries, come for the one you call Jerrell. / / Jerrell, there's some funny midgets here for you. / Just because we're short doesn't mean we're not deadly professionals. / / Can you do tricks? / That's it. Frank, bite his kneecaps off. / I can't reach. http://www.goats.com/archive/010905.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010907.html
Those midgets weren't funny at all. / This is getting a bit tired. / / You mean, when we have to rescue one of our strange friends from an even more bizarre captor? / We should consider the possibility that Jerrell is better off this way. / / Maybe the midgets have made him their king. Maybe they feed him royal jelly and give him free manicures on Thursdays. / I would kill for free weekly manicures. http://www.goats.com/archive/010907.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010910.html
I came as soon as I heard. Are you two okay? / We're fine, sweetie. How did you know? / / It's all over Slashnut. They're up in arms over Jerrell and "Hacker Rights". / How would they have found out so quickly? / / Dunno. How did you untie yourselves? / I just inhaled deeply. The great white beast did the bulk of the work. http://www.goats.com/archive/010910.html

How will we New Yorkers get past the World Trade Center tragedy? / The same way we always do in times of trouble - man will reach out to his fellow man. / / So that means you'll go rescue Jerrell? / Is Jerrell a man?

Given recent events, I feel it's important that people forget their little grudges and come together. / Fantastic. / / In that spirit, I forgive you for your earlier hateful comment comparing my body to that of a prepubescent child's. / Great.

I wrote a funny joke about the tragedy. / Don't tell anyone. They'll think you're a deviant. / / But it's really funny. What should I do? / Just change the subject of the joke to something else.

C'mon, Toothie. We need it bad. / Sorry ladies. Not tonight. / / But we need consoling, Toothie. / Don't take it personal, Jolene.

Hi there. / Hi. We're the ones behind Jerrell's kidnapping. We're terribly sorry about the whole mess. / / / Demons, eh? / Yes.

It's really quite a story, actually. Jerrell was going to be the centerpiece of a complex plot to replace the president with a remote-controlled automaton who would obey our every command. / / / Then that whole terrorist thing went down, and, well, it wouldn't really have been appropriate at the time.

You realize what this money means? / Yeah. The next Pee-wee Herman movie is about to get financing. / / No... it means we can move out.

Jon, I... I have to talk to you. I'm moving out. I'm buying an apartment. / You're leaving? / / I know how lonely you'll be, so I'm leaving the animals with you. / No, you take them. I insist.

So, big news about Phillip buying an apartment, huh? I suppose he'll be getting a place for you both? / Apartment? / / He... um. He hasn't told you. / No. / / This is the sort of situation where I always regret not having taken that hypnotism class. http://www.goats.com/archive/001002.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/001003.html
Why did Lauren just walk out in a huff? / You haven't told her about the new apartment yet? / / Oh hell. You told her. / Odds are good she would have found out when she came over and you weren't living here. / / So? It's not like I'd be here to deal with the aftermath. / Pretty sneaky, sis. http://www.goats.com/archive/001003.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/001004.html
What women say: / I mean, he's getting an apartment, and he hasn't even told me? It's not as if I'm definitely ready to move in with him, but don't you think it's something we could have discussed together? / / What goats hear: / I am emotionally vulnerable. / Apologies to Gary Larson http://www.goats.com/archive/001004.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/001005.html
So Phillip's buying an apartment, and he hasn't asked you to move in with him? / He hasn't even told me. / / Well, do you want to live with him? / Well, eventually, but... no. I guess not. / / Perfect. You'll want to follow plan R-15. / Slight guilt followed by a bit of subtle manipulation. I like. http://www.goats.com/archive/001005.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/001006.html
Lauren, we have to talk. / Actually, Phillip, I've been meaning to talk to you as well. / / I'm thinking about leaving New York. I'm just not sure what's left for me here. It's depressing. I miss seeing leaves and greenery and nature. / / So? I'll buy you a salad. / Oh, Phillip. Not every problem can be solved with salad. http://www.goats.com/archive/001006.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/001010.html
So Lauren is going to leave New York. I'm buying a new apartment, but I know that I'm not ready to move in with her. / / Wacky isn't going to cut it this time. If I want her to stay, I'm going to have to do something... sentimental. / Yup. / / Cheese logs aren't considered sentimental, are they? / Nope. http://www.goats.com/archive/001010.html

Here. Put this on. / White after Labor Day? Really, Phillip, how tacky. / / It's a blindfold. I have a surprise for you. / You're not going to put on those leather chaps and make me call you "Fritz," are you? / / It's not like that. We're going outside. / You're not very reassuring, Phillip. http://www.goats.com/archive/001011.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/001012.html
Okay... Just a few more steps... and take off the blindfold. / / Oh Phillip... It's beautiful. / It's the terrace for my new apartment. Now you won't have to leave the city to enjoy a bit of nature. / / Thank you, Phillip. I love it. / Good, because if you leave New York, the death of all those hydrangeas will be on your hands. http://www.goats.com/archive/001012.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/001013.html
So I'll be needing some help taking care of the garden. / I suppose I could help with that. / / It would be appreciated. / Of course, it's a long trip out here. I'll need to stay over occasionally. / / I saved you a drawer. / You're a prince. http://www.goats.com/archive/001013.html

Man, I love autumn... that chill wind... / Ah, yes... late October, and a young chicken's mind turns to Satan. / / Satan. / There's evil in the air, Jon.

It's enough already, Diablo. / But I just ordered another Cosmopolitan. / / No, the whole Satanism schtick.

Look, if you're going to accuse me of being a lapsed Satanist, you'd better slap on a yarmulke and start conserving pork before the Hypocrisy Patrol comes and locks you away. / / That's not what I'm saying. / So what ARE you saying? / / I...

http://www.goats.com/archive/001024.html
Well, if we're going to defend ourselves, we'll need a base of operations. / Pub. Excellent. Check. / / We'll need a way to barricade ourselves in so Lori can't get to us. / N.Y.U. fratboy corpses.

What do you mean, Lori coming back?!? / Don't worry, Tommy, the Geek Patrol has the situation in hand. / / She is fired!

http://www.goats.com/archive/001026.html
If we're going to help Jon and Phillip keep that dirty zombie Lori out of here, we'll need a plan of attack. / / Bob, try to create a distraction. / A distraction from what? / / Jerrell... Jerrell, go gnaw on something in a manner that will scare zombies. / Die Die Die / Does distraction mean "Blow stuff up"? I can do that. http://www.goats.com/archive/001026.html

http://www.goats.com/archive/001101.html
Diablo, look what you've done... you've driven everyone into a frenzy for nothing. They're still extinguishing the toilets, you ridiculed me in front of my friends, and we can't get Jerrell to stop gnawing on the customers. / / I want you to think about what you've done here. Was it really worth it? / / Every minute. http://www.goats.com/archive/001101.html

Where the hell is everybody? / Taken away by the Celera Stormtroopers. Who knows where... / / Well. This is boring. Who will I torment with my adorable antics now? / They took Mitzi and Claire.

See? I told you that Mendel was behind this.

August 10, 3:21pm / Toothgnip and I have disguised ourselves as Celera Stormtroopers and stowed away on board one of their transports. If our efforts fail, this journal will be the only record of our heroic efforts. / / August 10, 3:44pm / In a valiant effort to stave off boredom, Toothgnip and I have taken to playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors." A lack of fingers on both our parts has made the game rather difficult to play. / / August 10, 3:57pm / Toothgnip has declined my offer to play poker. His excuse: "We have no cards." I think the stress of our upcoming siege may play a part in his reticence as well. I will attempt to engage him in a game of checkers. http://www.goats.com/archive/000810.html

...and we should have New Jersey cleared out by morning. / Excellent work, Venter.

Never thought I'd say this, but it's good to see you guys. / Nothing brings people together like a naked fat man. / / Why did he kidnap your head, Diablo? / Something to do with replacing his steel nipples with ones made from my comb. / / Why your comb? / The head of a cock is soft and strokable. / Something Jon is well aware of. http://www.goats.com/archive/010309.html

Wondering where your favorite characters have gone? Delve into the dirty underbelly of comic strip hiring practices as we go... / BEHIND the SCENES / Day 1: Cheese of Evil / / It was a matter of artistic differences, really. I was ad-libbing during the shoot, and I said to Toothgnip, I said, "Behold the power of cheese!" instead of one of the scripted lines. / / Everyone on the set loved it, but Jon started shouting about how I was "Destroying the integrity of the script."

Even comic strip celebrities have everyday problems... everyday needs. Sometimes health problems get in the way of cartoon success... / BEHIND the SCENES / Day 5: Jedi Mouse / / I joined goats back in the early days, back before it was only about money. But at least we had a benefits package. / / But when I needed medical help, the insurance company rejected my claim. They said that death was a pre-existing condition.

But time gives you perspective. Time allows for comparative analysis. / How so? / / Fractal-style patterns are inherent in everything. It's a property of the universe and our lives.

Talking...difficult. / Take a deep breath, and we'll go sit down by the giant mosquitoes. http://www.goats.com/archive/001129.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/001201.html
...so it looks like I'll be in town a few months while we get this site built. / You're an internet consultant. / / Yeah. The travel is a pain, but the money is good. / Where are you staying? / / At a hotel, downtown. But I'd much rather stay with you. If that's ok. / Alan Funt is back there, right? http://www.goats.com/archive/001201.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/001204.html
You seriously want to come and stay with me? / Sure, I mean... / If it's okay... / Are you, um, seeing anyone? / / Who, me? No, No. Not really. / Yeah. Me neither. / / You can understand I'm still having some trouble processing all this. / You can work on it while I get my stuff. http://www.goats.com/archive/001204.html

Phillip, I need your help. What's the name of that mystery girl? / Madonna / / No, you know... / The girl with no name. From reunion. / You meant the horse with no name. From the desert. / / C'mon Phillip. I'm serious. / Yahoo Serious? http://www.goats.com/archive/001206.html

A girl is coming to live with us in an hour, and I don't even know her name. / You rock my small, self-centered universe. / / This is a real problem. How will I alert her to danger, or the availability of food? / You could ask her what her name is. / / No. I'd look stupid. / Well, yes, but that's a genetic condition. http://www.goats.com/archive/001208.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/001211.html
It could be worse. You could have Hirsch Sprung's Disease. / I don't even want to know what that is. / / Symptoms include bowel movements the size of footballs. / That's unreasonable. / / Did you know John Wayne Died with 63 pounds of excrement in his bowels? / What the hell are you reading? http://www.goats.com/archive/001211.html

The doorman is going to buzz her up any minute now. / You should run away. / / No. / Fine. You should sick rabid coelacanths on her. / / Where am I supposed to find coelacanths at this time of day? / Process doesn't concern me. I'm a high-level thinker. http://www.goats.com/archive/001213.html

Oh Hell. She's here and I still don't know her name. / Run now while you still have a chance. / Buzz buzz / / Click / Hello? / I'll tell her you were maimed in one of those tragic blimp accidents you're always getting in. / / Megan is here to see you. / Thank you. / Lucky bastard. http://www.goats.com/archive/001215.html

Wow. What was that? / The leaping piranha. From one of my old tantra classes. / / You learned that at college? / Yup. You don't remember? That used to be your favorite. / / I think my memory is going to need a lot of refreshing. / I suggest you call in sick to work this week. http://www.goats.com/archive/001222.html

jon is having sex. / Liar. Did you see the "Help Wanted" sign outside of Wendy's? / / No, really. Furniture is being up-ended as we speak. / It said "Expanding Staff"! / / I can't take it, Phillip. / Oh, c'mon. It's only a mild double entendre. http://www.goats.com/archive/001225.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/001227.html
Thanks for letting me move in while the sex continues / No problem. / / Why are you decorating that tree with miniature snowboarders? / It's our X'mas tree. / / A little late aren't you? / The 'X' stands for 'Xtreme'. http://www.goats.com/archive/001227.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/001229.html
I can't believe I missed X'mas again. / I blame Jon. Jon ruined our X'mas. / / Him and his 'Jew-People', always ruining holidays and killing deities. / And having loud, animalistic sex. / / Sex with deities? / Yes, Phillip. All the time. http://www.goats.com/archive/001229.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010101.html
Well, we may have missed Xmas but I won't let the Jews ruin New Years! / Uh... Phillip? / / We'll have a big party with lots of beer, and dancing monkeys, and transvestites! It'll be the best New Year's ever! / We missed New Years too. / / I said, "it'll be the best New Years ever"... / I'll go get the monkeys. http://www.goats.com/archive/010101.html

Thanks. I'm parched. / Here's your water. / / What do you say we go out tonight? Take a break? / Good idea. I think I've run out of sperm. / / They're showing the director's cut of "Brazil" at the Angelika. / And we can get you a diamond ring on the way home. http://www.goats.com/archive/010103.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010105.html
So you don't have a boyfriend, you're not psychotic, and you like Gilliam movies. / Yes on all counts. / / And you're not a zombie, you don't have feet growing out of your face, and you don't have sexual relationships with musical instruments. / Yes. / / I don't get it. So what is wrong with you? / Sounds like I should be asking that question. http://www.goats.com/archive/010105.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/010108.html
Two for "Brazil", please. / I mean, this just doesn't happen. Something must be wrong here. / / That'll be nineteen dollars, please. / And you're paying for the tickets, so you can't be after my money... / / Oh, but I am...

Mendle continued his spiel. "Of course, now that you and Twix have conveniently delivered yourselves to me, my elaborate plans for revenge have been foiled. But, as I am a somewhat sporting villian, and not altogether bright, I suggest we have a small competition." / / "We will pit my army of robotic basketball players against your beloved Harlem Globetrotters. The loser will be killed, and the winner will be given the deed to Gilligan's Island." I reminded Mendel that he had neither the robots nor the deed to the fictional isle. / / After some discussion, we agreed that Mendel and Twix would meet in deadly combat at the upcoming head-to-head roller-biathlon competition, deciding once and for all who would reign over the H.T.H.R.B.L, and who would perish. http://www.goats.com/archive/000327.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000328.html
Mendel's henchmen returned Shazam Twix to me, somewhat battered but without any permanent damage. We retired to our Brussels flat, where Twix began the recovery process with a bongful of Chex Mix and Tabasco sauce. / / The two-week training period began in earnest the following day. I put Twix on a strict diet of Chinese take-out (beefpork with chicken) and "Lemur Patrol" cereal (marshmallows shaped like militant lemurs, part of this complete breakfast.) / / Twix's training regimen consisted of daily strolls through the neighborhood park (armed with a quiver of baguettes in case of mime attack) and frequent games of ski-ball at "Eddie's World of Ski-Ball." Twix won a stuffed salamander. http://www.goats.com/archive/000328.html

The tournament was brutal. Concessions sales were slow. http://www.goats.com/archive/000329.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000330.html
The two surviving combatants, Twix and Mendel, stepped into the arena to face off for the head-to-head roller-biathlon finals. The tension was as thick as a community college student. The referee blew his whistle, and the match began. / / BLAM / BLAM / / Overtime is rarely a concern in head-to-head roller-biathlon. http://www.goats.com/archive/000330.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000331.html
Let's ignore, for a moment, that I have never heard such an anticlimactic ending in all my life. Just tell me, what was the point of your little story? / / I think that it was clear. / Assume that it wasn't clear to me. Would you be so kind as to explain? / / You have to look deep within yourself for that answer, jon. / I'll look deep within you. Someone get me a knife. / I learned that violence is good. http://www.goats.com/archive/000331.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/000403.html
Negativity isn't going to help Phillip win, Jon. / Neither are rambling inspirational speeches. It's a moot point, anyway, since we've missed the competition. / / You, know, I resent you two discussing me as though I wasn't here. Did you ever think to ask what I wanted? / / Fine, Phillip. What do you want? / I don't know. Diablo, what is it that I want? / A pony. A vampire pony. http://www.goats.com/archive/000403.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000404.html
You're quite the fashion plate today. / I'm not going to work. Ever again. / / You work? / Yes, I work. Who do you think puts food on your plate? / / I simply assumed it was the beef fairy. I didn't think you were capable of productivity. / That's it. I'm getting a dog. http://www.goats.com/archive/000404.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000405.html
Toothgnip says you're not going to work. / There's just something so pointless about the daily grind. I won't do it. / / Cheer up, Jon. Have a snack. Snacks make everything better. / Whatcha got? / / 'Jesus Snaps' communion wafers. Chocolate. Nummy. / "Jesus sez: They're made from my body!" http://www.goats.com/archive/000405.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000406.html
You work? / Yes, well, I did, but I'm not going to the office anymore. / / There's something fundamentally wrong with working 60 hours a week just to earn a paycheck so that I can feed myself so that I can continue to work 60 hours a week. Mere survival just isn't enough. / / I call dibs on jon's CDs! / Survival is overrated anyway. / Don't you ever leave? http://www.goats.com/archive/000406.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000407.html
You want some egg salad, Jon? / No! I don't want any goddamn egg salad!! / / All I want is for you people to leave me alone! I want to lock myself in my room, and not have to deal with work or chickens or women, and slowly waste away in pointless obscurity! / / Whoa. Egg salad doesn't normally provoke that sort of reaction. / The real irony is that I spiked it with tranquilizers. http://www.goats.com/archive/000407.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/000410.html
Jon? Are you in here? / Lynda? What are you doing here? / / Well, you haven't been down to the pub in a few days. / Since when do bartenders make housecalls? / / Let's just say that we have a vested interest in seeing that you and Phillip are okay. / My checkbook is in the top drawer. http://www.goats.com/archive/000410.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000411.html
So you've decided not to go to work anymore? / Well, between you and me, it wasn't my decision. I was fired. / / It's part of their new "Happiness Initiative." The Productivity Czar said that although I was an excellent worker, my bad attitude was bringing down the morale of the other employees, and affecting the "Overall Happiness Quotient." / / You? A bad attitude? I don't believe it. / Look, did you bring any beer, or just sarcasm? http://www.goats.com/archive/000411.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000412.html
I don't mean to pry, Jon, but avoiding the outside world... it's not healthy. / No, it's great! / / My life is full of adventure. The other day, I was going to heat up a can of ravioli for lunch, and then I realized that I didn't own a can opener! So I ate some cereal instead. And I save a lot of money on laundry. / / Well, the bathrobe certainly suits you. / I'm working on a way to convert Kleenex boxes into shoes. http://www.goats.com/archive/000412.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000413.html
I'm fine. This is fine. I can sell my blood. / C'mon, Jon. It's time to stand up for yourself. / / You're going to go up to your boss and ask for your job back. / Can I email her? / / No. Let's go. / No... NO! Not the sun! It burns! http://www.goats.com/archive/000413.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000414.html
Hello? / Jon! You're back! What are you doing here? / / Oh, hi Scott. I, uh... I came to ask Jennie for my job back. / Man, I have to tell you, things have been amazing here since you left. So much better. / / Thanks. I'm just going to go now. / God, I love my job! Pardon me, I feel the need to caress my stapler. http://www.goats.com/archive/000414.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/000417.html
Jon! How have you been? Didn't we fire you? / Ah, hi Jennie. Do you have a moment? / / Since you've been gone, people go out after work together, overall smiling has increased 35%, we've planted a garden, and we've adopted an office puppy. His name is Roger. / / Ah. Well. It was nice talking to you. / Oh, c'mon. Sit. Have some coffee. http://www.goats.com/archive/000417.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000418.html
So everything's better. / Well, pretty much everything. Except productivity is down 20%. / / What? / Well, I mean, it's okay. We're happy. / / Happy? Work isn't supposed to be fun! You're supposed to be miserable. It's unnatural to enjoy your work. / Yeah, I know. But we're having such a blast without you. http://www.goats.com/archive/000418.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000419.html
So that's it? Three years of loyal, dedicated service and I'm just... fired? / So you've been listening. / / C'mon, Jennie. I have a chicken to support. / Okay, fine. I think I can find some freelance work for you. / / Wait... so I still get paid, and I never have to go outside? / Only if you promise not to talk to anyone here. Ever. http://www.goats.com/archive/000419.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000420.html
C'mon, I'll introduce you to the new girl. She's in your old cube. / You've already replaced me? / / You honestly think we could replace you with someone from off the street? / Well, no, of course not. / / We replaced you with an Excel spreadsheet. / But it's a big spreadsheet, right? With macros and stuff? http://www.goats.com/archive/000420.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000421.html
Jon, meet Vanessa. She's our new production manager. / Hi. / So, you brought me another J-14, huh? / / He's got the jawline of a J-14, doesn't he? / Yup. / Jennie... what's she talking about? / / Haven't a clue, really. She's a bit insane. But she makes excellent coffee. / Don't you ever interview these people first? / Hold on... I think this was predicted on my star chart. http://www.goats.com/archive/000421.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/000424.html
We're matched, you know. Brought together by cosmic fates. / Uh. / / Yes... this day was foretold in legend. There would be a meeting of the seventh daughter and the lowly son of a shepherd. / My dad is a mechanic. / / We will have dinner when the crescent moon arrives. Iron your shirt. / Am I on Candid Camera or something? http://www.goats.com/archive/000424.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000425.html
I just don't know. Should I go out with this woman? I feel like I'll be betraying Holly. / The imaginary girl from England? / / She's not imaginary, dammit. She's real. / Did you have little tea parties with her? / / Yes, but that's besides the point. / "Mr. Snuffles, please pass the sugar to Mrs. Teddy Bear..." http://www.goats.com/archive/000425.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000426.html
So what's better... dating an available madwoman, or pining for an unavailable Englishwoman? / Move to England. / / If only it were that easy, I've missed Holly so much the past few months. I don't know what to do. / Move to England. / / Yeah, I suppose I have to face facts... go with what I have. / Move to England, dammit. http://www.goats.com/archive/000426.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000427.html
Hi, Vanessa? Um... about dinner... / Ah, Jon. I knew you would call. / / We interrupt your regularly scheduled storyline for this special goats report: / ELIAN / Tales of a First-Grade Assassin / / ...and when Castro goes to shake your hand, you'll give him this explosive finger painting. / Tengo gusto de comer creyones. http://www.goats.com/archive/000427.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000428.html
We've been training you for months, Elian... waiting for this moment. / Escribo con un lapiz. / / Are you ready, Elian?!? Ready to free your countrymen?!? / Tengo un perro pequeno. / / Excellent! Now let's go kick some commie ass. / Su madre era un hamster. http://www.goats.com/archive/000428.html

NY 1 / Keith Shellac / ...in other news, a plane carrying young Elian Gonzalez back to his native Cuba has disappeared. F.A.A. officials fear that the plane may have crashed into the ocean. / / NY 1 / Keith Shellac / Cuban President Fidel Castro responded to the tragedy, stating "Mi ropa es muy pegajosa." We're not sure what that means, but the threat is clear. / / NY 1 / Keith Shellac / Presidential candidate George W. Bush responded to Castro's words with a declaration of war, saying "My daddy says Fidel is a poopy-head." Bush then snorted an 8-ball and mooned the camera. http://www.goats.com/archive/000502.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000503.html
They found Elian. He washed up on the Miami shore. / What is that, the Enquirer? / / Hell no. It's the Post. / Great. They're going to go through the whole extraction process again. / / Doesn't he look strange here? As if he has a metallic sheen... / And a goatee is an odd fashion choice for a 6-year old. http://www.goats.com/archive/000503.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000504.html
Well, we were worried for a while, but Elian is back, and none the worse for wear. / SEIS SEIS SEIS MORIR MORIR / Live / / Elian, are you concerned that the delay in your return to Cuba will worsen international relations and push us closer to a state of war? / MORIR FORNICAR MORIR / Live / / He may be confused, but one thing is for sure: Elian is not a robotic automaton from the future bent on world domination. / MORIR MORIR MORIR http://www.goats.com/archive/000504.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000505.html
...and so, our tale of assassins, weasels, robots, and child custody comes to a close. For now. We now return you to your regularly scheduled storyline, already in progress. / / Jon. We're on. / / Oh. Ah... well, that sure was a wacky adventure I had with... um... Vanessa. Yeah. / Yes. It was very wacky. And zany. http://www.goats.com/archive/000505.html

Did you hear? Sex Dwarf and his giant Robot of Sexual Destruction have mysteriously disappeared! The city is safe! / Yeah. Great. / / Wait... what happened to your koala? / The traitorous bastard ran off. I tried to restrain him, but... / / Koalas are surprisingly strong. http://www.goats.com/archive/000214.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000215.html
So, I have this friend... / Really? Where'd you get that? / You paying him? / / No... I have a friend... / Another one? / Man, she's loaded. / / Forget it. / What a bastard. She's forsaken her new friends. / How will they eat? http://www.goats.com/archive/000215.html

In the town where I was born, lived a man who wouldn't eat... / And he told us of his life, in the land of Soylent Green... / / So we shopped in many stores, 'till we found some people-meat... / And we ate all that we could, from a bowl of Soylent Green! / / WE ALL LIVE IN A BOWL OF SOYLENT GREEN, A BOWL OF SOYLENT GREEN, A BOWL OF SOYLENT GREEN... / WE ALL LIVE IN A BOWL OF SOYLENT GREEN, A BOWL OF SOYLENT GREEN, A BOWL OF SOYLENT GREEN... / Soylent Green is made from Beatles! http://www.goats.com/archive/000216.html

Cracker Jack prizes? What'd you get this time? / Dunno- maybe it's "Magic Cellophane". The transparent, flexible glass! / / My favorite was "Shiny Paper"- the paper that's shiny! / Look. It's a "Paper Puzzle". You rip up the paper and put it back together again. / / Be careful not to hurt yourself. / Quiet. I'm concentrating. http://www.goats.com/archive/000217.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000218.html
What the hell happened to Cracker Jack prizes, anyway? They used to be so cool when I was a kid. / It's a liability issue. / / They don't make the plastic toys anymore 'cause every once in a while, some Darwin Awards candidate chokes on one. So they make them so lame that no one could possibly want to play with 'em. / / That's a shame. / Dammit, these two won't line up. Line up, puzzle pieces! http://www.goats.com/archive/000218.html

People Magazine says that we fall right inbetween the age ranges for Generation X and Generation Y. / That sucks. / / They also have an informative and touching interview with Tom Hanks. / I want to be categorized by the media too, dammit. / / "Will we be lucky enough to see a 'Bachelor Party 2', Mr Hanks?" asks People. / What about my need to be generalized and easily dismissed? http://www.goats.com/archive/000221.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000222.html
Maybe she gets off on tazers? / Why would you even think something like that? / / Dunno. She's just standing there with her arms crossed, and I thought, "Maybe she enjoys a good taze." / There is something provocative about a woman with her arms crossed. / / It's almost like she's feeling her own breasts. That's not fair. / Hey! If you're not going to bring enough for everyone, don't bring any at all! http://www.goats.com/archive/000222.html

Well, if you're not going to pay attention to me, then I think I'll just have to find someone who will. / Fine. / / Why is it that women are always insisting on talking so much? / Doesn't look like she's talking much with that frat boy. Looks like she's kissing him. / / I can't believe my girlfriend gave sugar to another man. / You'll be needing a sugar substitute, then. http://www.goats.com/archive/000223.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000224.html
Fine. Lauren, I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention to you. Now can I go? / Say it. / / C'mon. I've already apologized. / That boy over there is awfully cute.

Why is everything so two-dimensional? / That's just a side effect of hanging out with space time. / / Well, it's difficult for me to get any work done like this. / That's OK, we're going down to the pub... so Space Time can get bent! Ha ha ha! / / Leave now. / Get it? So Space Time can get bent? / Hi! http://www.goats.com/archive/000229.html

We may therefore identify two possibilities regarding the convection of beer. It may be assumed an universal constant independent of all frames of reference, or, conversely, it may be assumed to propagate at a constant speed in / / any direction only within the observer's frame of reference.

Isn't that just a bit unsanitary? / I'm bulking up. / / More? Are you planning on hibernating for the rest of the year? / World's Strongest Man Competition. / / No you're not. / Excuse me, but training sessions are closed to the press. / More please. http://www.goats.com/archive/000306.html

How's your training coming along? / My pumping arm hurts. / / Suck it up. We have a meeting with Nike at noon for a potential sponsorship contract. / Ooh. Can you get me a pair of those shoes with the air in them? / / Shut up and keep drinking. / Yeah. The keg throw is much easier when it's empty. http://www.goats.com/archive/000307.html

He wants to be the World's Strongest Man, so I'm training him. / But why, Diablo? There must be some nefarious scheme you have in mind. / / There's no reason, jon. You're being paranoid. Sometimes I just do stuff for fun. / It's something to do with Satan, right? For Satan? / / Yes, Jon, you've figured me out. We're athletes of Satan. / I knew it. http://www.goats.com/archive/000308.html

I know you guys have some trepidation about Phillip's newfound interest ing the World's Strongest Man Competition. As his trainer, I feel that it's my responsibility to share with you a story from my youth... a tale of dreams and despair, of troubles and triumph. / / Is this another one of those stories that seems to last for weeks, is completely fabricated, and ends up having no bearing on the situation at hand? A rambling mass of incoherence? / / Maybe. And if it is, you'll sit there and listen anyway. It's free. / I reserve the right to bitch and moan. / Big surprise. http://www.goats.com/archive/000310.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/000313.html
As you both know, I was once heavily involved in the European bocce circuit due to the influence of my one-eyed, robotic-limbed Frenchman friend, Shazam Twix. After losing his job in the vineyards of epernay due to what the authorities termed "excessive drug use", sport was his only solace. / / He did rather well for himself on the circuit, as many of the other players were of similar character, and helped to mask his eccentricities. Despite his tendency to become sidetracked in debates with invisible giraffes, he was an exemplary player, and rarely licked anyone without prior permission. / / Twix was ranked third on the continent until one fateful evening, when after a particularly frenetic binge hopped up on mainlined cocoa and fetus extract, he accidentally ate a referee. Such things were frowned upon in the world of bocce. http://www.goats.com/archive/000313.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000314.html
After a brief but violent discussion with the Bocce Tribunal, Twix was banished from the sport for referee consumption ahnd excessive flatulence. Having first lost his job (and access to the luscious and morally-challenged champagne cellar tour guides), and now with his precious bocce taken away, he was crushed. / / The next three months were an endless torment for both Twix and myself, as I had to repeatedly talk him down from his experimentations with the hallucinogenic effects of Ham 'n' Cheese Hot Pocket overdosing. He babbled endlessly about his "next big thing." / / After toying with flawed (the Monkey Fund: a mutual fund run by monkeys, investing only in monkey-friendly stocks) and hopeless (the Hootie Channel: all Hootie, all the time) business ideas, Shazam Twix decided to re-enter the world of sport. But this time, he would rise through the ranks of head-to-head roller-biathlon. http://www.goats.com/archive/000314.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000315.html
It was decided that day that we would move to Brussels, the "New Jersey of Europe" and the unofficial home of head-to-head roller-biathlon culture. We packed Twix's 1981 Mercury Zephyr with the meager contents of our squatter's flat (a toilet brush, a variety of sporting goods, and 15 kilos of Nutella) and headed for Belgium. / / Life on the road was grand... there were sheep... and some additional sheep... man, there were a lot of sheep. They were everywhere. Pretty much a sheep anywhere you looked. They ate grass and walked around a bit. / / I guess it's hard to keep the action flowing when you're making stuff up on the spot. / I am not. Sheep are integral to the tone of the story. / Were the sheep beautiful? http://www.goats.com/archive/000315.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000316.html
After several days of adventure on the road (and a quick stop at "Mini-Europe" for photos), we arrived at our new flat in Brussels, overlooking the Grand-Place. Getting into the spirit of the city, Twix shared his "Manneken Pis" impression with the tourists below our balcony. / / After unloading the Zephyr, we struck out on the cobblestone streets of the city, looking for frites and head-to-head roller-biathlon sparring partners. We found frites; it was somewhat harder to find people willing to take a bullet in the name of sport. / / As we walked, the bright pink of a photocopied flyer taped to a lamppost caught my eye. I plucked it from the post. It was an advertisement for the upcoming roller-biathlon tournament, to be held right there in Brussels, two weeks from the day. I turned to show Twix, but he was nowhere to be seen. http://www.goats.com/archive/000316.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000317.html
Suddenly, I found myself as alone as a fat girl on a Friday night*. Shazam Twix was gone, with only a few oddly-shaped leaves blowing in circles where he had stood moments before. It was getting dark, and I felt a pressing need to get off the streets. / *No, I'm not calling you fat. Get over yourself. / / I ducked into a nearby bar, aptly named "Planet Cocktail Bar." It was packed with greasy Belgians sipping fruit-laden drinks, swaying to trance-inducing house music. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than Planet Cocktail Bar. / / / / I ordered my customary Long Island Iced Tea, and sat myself down in a booth with three blonde Belgian beauties. I spoke to them the only French phrase that Twix had taught me: "I, too, enjoy the soccer." But those five words were more than enough... http://www.goats.com/archive/000317.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/000320.html
Having read as much Brussels-specific tourist literature as possible, I was keenly aware of the native reverence for the art of comics. I was also keenly aware that Belgians were as easy as mac 'n' cheese. I plied the buxom blondes with tales of my career as a comic stripper back in the States. / / My three dates were so overwhelmed by my stunning (albeit fabricated) revelation that they immediately invited me back to their sorority house for a sweaty, sticky three-way. Just then, I noticed another of those oddly-shaped leaves on the floor of the bar. / / My mind returned to Shazam Twix and his disappearance. I recalled the words he had spoken to me just that morning: "Toast is just over-cooked bread." And I knew then that he was right. Determined to find Twix, I sent the girls on their way with only my promise to call them. http://www.goats.com/archive/000320.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000321.html
Something about the oddly-shaped leaves triggered a memory. On a hunch, I followed the trail of leaves towards the back of Planet Cocktail Bar, through a brightly-colored beaded curtain. The beads were pretty. Pretty, pretty beads. / / Were they pretty in the way that post-nose job Jennifer Grey is pretty? / More in a fully-loaded pizza sort of way. / Hello? Story? / / I think she was prettier before the nose job. / Jon, I think you could stand to relax a bit. / Diablo, I think you've been smoking too many of those oddly-shaped leaves. http://www.goats.com/archive/000321.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000322.html
I pulled aside the beaded curtain. There, in the back room of Planet Cocktail Bar, was none other than my nemesis, the evil Gregor Mendel, father of modern genetics and ex-wrestling champion! / / How did he survive the explosion with which we had detroyed his laboratory? What was he doing here in Brussels? Why did his skin now have an eerie green tinge to it? Had I remembered to turn off the oven that morning? And what had he done with Shazam Twix? / / "Ah, Diablo, my friend," the evil one intoned, his hands rubbing together like two horny, incestuous tectonic plates. "Finally, a chance for us to have that dim-sum we talked about so long ago. Come, and have some of my sticky balls." http://www.goats.com/archive/000322.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000323.html
Mendel settled back into his seat and began to talk. "Our last, shall we say, 'explosive' encounter left me with severe burns over 90% of my body. I stitched myself together over five months of painful genetically-engineered plant-skin transplants." / / "Five months of torturous pain is a long time, Diablo. Five months of nothing but pondering revenge against you and your friend Twix. That, and reading 'Newsweek'. And sampling different varieties of Ben 'n' Jerry's wonderful ice cream flavors." / / "And, of course, the occasional game of Yahtzee, but, as we all know, my sentient pea-plant henchmen aren't very good game players, so there was little challenge there. They often ate the dice. But mostly, I pondered revenge. Revenge and monkeys. Monkeys are funny." http://www.goats.com/archive/000323.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000324.html
Mendel chewed thoughtfully on his pork buns. "Once I had recovered from the skin transplants, I found that I no longer had the upper-body strength to maintain my wrestling career. Only the solace of thrice-daily pints of 'Phish Food' kept me from slipping into permanent depression." / / "I needed a new way to generate income to fund my genetic engineering, world-domination and revenge-related activites. I did a brief stint at the home 'n' garden department of 'Home Despot', but $6.20 an hour doesn't go as far now as it did back in the 1800s." / / "Clearly, I needed a new sport to dominate- a sport that catered to my violent impulses and love for phallic symbolism. A sport dripping in cash and blood. I decided then that I would counquer the world of head-to-head roller-biathlon." http://www.goats.com/archive/000324.html

Dave! Wow, I haven't seen you in, like, two or three weeks. How's life? / Life is good, Jon. A delightful conundrum, ever unfolding. / / Did your brother make it up here for reunion? / Kevin? Wouldn't miss it. He's over by the registration booth, flirting with the check-in girl. / / I suggest you go and find out if my room has an eastern exposure, Miss, or you'll be picking splinters out of your intestine. http://www.goats.com/archive/000628.html

http://www.goats.com/archive/000705.html
So you have no memory of us dating at all. / Honestly, no. I'm so sorry. / / The semi-formal? The evening walks across campus? / Nothing. It was junior year... I had a bong permanently attached to my face. / / That explains so much. / Can you explain it to me? All I remember is listening to Tom Petty. http://www.goats.com/archive/000705.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000706.html
So the entire time I was seeing you... / Yes, I was stoned out of my gourd. Lived with some interesting people that year. / / You seem relatively stable now. / When I started calling an empty Yodel box an "evil whore", I knew it was time to cut back a bit. / / It's okay. I was stoned most of the time, too. / Ah. So that's why you dated me. http://www.goats.com/archive/000706.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000707.html
Actually, you may not be the only ex of mine that's here. / I know. Celia is here with her husband. / / You know her? / Yeah. You broke up with me to date her. / / Oh, you're joking. / Well, I wasn't attracted to you for your intelligence anyway. http://www.goats.com/archive/000707.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000710.html
It was fantastic seeing you again, Jon. Call me sometime. / Okay. / / / Who was that? / Damned if I know. http://www.goats.com/archive/000710.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/000711.html
So, you ran into a girl whom you've actually dated, and who spent the afternoon with you, of her own free will. / Yes. / / And you completely neglected to find out her name or any information that would allow you to find her later. / That's the gist of it. / / Well, she clearly wasn't attracted to you for your intelligence. / That's already been established. http://www.goats.com/archive/000711.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000712.html
C'mon, Jon. I know what'll cheer you up. / That woman's phone number? / / Better. We'll break into her room. Kev, break into her room. / Excellent. / / She's not staying in the dorm, though. / Details. / Whoa! She has all the same stuff we do. http://www.goats.com/archive/000712.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000713.html
She wasn't imaginary. She was real. / Did anyone else talk to this disappearing ex with no name? / / No. No one else talked to her. / Maybe she's been chatting with your imaginary girlfriend from england. / / Go pack your stuff. We're going home. / Taken care of. Ghandi and the easter bunny are bringing my bags as we speak. http://www.goats.com/archive/000713.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000714.html
Did you find him? / No. His room is empty and all his stuff is gone. / / Can't blame me this time. I didn't even get a chance to see him. / I just wish I had a chance to say goodbye before he left. / / I have his phone number if you want. / That's okay Celia. I'm sure he'll call if he wants to talk to me. http://www.goats.com/archive/000714.html

Whatcha reading, Diablo? / Uh... It's, Uh, The Satanic Verses. By Bob Guccione. Great stuff. / / No it's not... It looks like children's literature! / No!

Guess who's reading "Harry Potter!" / You'll keep your mouth shut if you know what's good for you. http://www.goats.com/archive/000717.html

http://www.goats.com/archive/000720.html
I can't believe you got my Harry Potter book taken away. You pansy. / It's okay. We can get it back. / / Oh yeah? How? / Easy. We throw a sock hop down at the school gym. We can raise enough cash to save the book *and* the school! / / That's it. I'm going to kick your ass. / Let's leave my ass out of this, shall we? http://www.goats.com/archive/000720.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000721.html
That's it, jon. Hand over the book, or prepare to face me in a WIZARD DUEL!! / / Here you are.

Welcome to NBC Nightly News. I'm Tom Brokaw. Today, Dr. J. Craig Venter, head of Celera Genomics, announced that his company has patented the human genome. / / "I think it's understandable that we would want to patent our assembly of the genome," Venter said at today's press conference. "Of course, anyone using the human genome without authorization will have to stop immediately." / / Disputing claims that God has a claim to prior art, U.S. Patent officials said that God has 30 days to file a counter-claim.

http://www.goats.com/archive/000803.html
Have you read the paper today? / Yeah. That bit about Charlton Heston in rehab had me rolling. / / No, the article about Celera. They've patented the human genome. / So? It's not my genome. / / Diablo, I'm going to have to return my genes to Celera. / If you've already worn them, they'll probably only give you store credit. http://www.goats.com/archive/000803.html

Jon, I've been doing some research on this whole genome patent thing, and it reeks of my old nemesis, Gregor Mendel. Only he would deny people the use of their own genetic material. / / Mendel's been dead for 116 years, Diablo. I looked it up. / But when you rearrange the letters in J. Craig Venter's name, it spells "Gregor Mendel". See? / / No it doesn't. It spells out "raving reject," though. / Yeah, but that's not much of a name for a nemesis. http://www.goats.com/archive/000804.html

Great. Diablo and Jerrell completely trashed our navigational computers. / / Now we'll have to wander space aimlessly, looking for a way home. / Ooh! I can be Matt LeBlanc, and you can be Heather Graham. / / Why can't you be Heather Graham? / 'Cause I'm not the one that lost that game of "Soggy Biscuit" this afternoon. http://www.goats.com/archive/000524.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000525.html
And so, our heroes set off on a quest to find their way home... a quest that would bring them in contact with a civilization of condensed monkeys... / / ...a quest where they would discover the fabled "Hamster of Knowledge" of Kronos VII... / I don't feel any smarter, but it's very comfortable. / / ...and a quest that would bring them into the inevitable bloody conflict with Gary Oldman. / I'm quite evil. http://www.goats.com/archive/000525.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/000526.html
If I have to visit one more planet full of condensed monkeys, I'm... I'm going to complain about it. / We need to find a way back to Earth, and soon. / / You'd think someone would open a cannery. / Liquid monkeys are the least of our problems, Diablo. / / Mph.

http://www.goats.com/archive/000529.html
So how do you plan to get us home? / It's easy, Diablo. You just have to believe in the power of music. / / So the ruby slippers have nothing to do with it? / Nah. I just think they're pretty. / / I FELL INTO A BURNING RING OF FIRE... / I went down, down, down and the flames went higher... / I FELL INTO A BURNING RING OF FIRE... / I went down, down, down and the flames went higher... / I FELL INTO A BURNING RING OF FIRE... / I went down, down, down and the flames went higher... / I FELL INTO A BURNING RING OF FIRE... / I went down, down, down and the flames went higher... http://www.goats.com/archive/000529.html

...so you were rescued by Johnny Cash, from certain doom, on a planet populated by condensed monkeys. / What, exactly, are you insinuating? / / That perhaps you're full of horse puckey. / You doubt the power of Cash?

An invitation to our college reunion has arrived. / It's been five years already? / / Give or take a few alcoholic comas. / Great.

At a rest stop on I-80... / Sir, your establishment is called "Hot and Crusty", yes? / / Yeah. / While that's unfortunate in and of itself, it creates certain expectatations.

Hi. Evil Jon, I presume? / Ah, Diablo. I'd wondered when you'd show up. / / Yeah. Lori's under a cow. / Just as well. I was beginning to chafe. / / I have more cows. Wanna see? / Anti-cow device. Don't bother. http://www.goats.com/archive/990323.html

With these evil Brooke Shields clones at my command... these efficient, single-minded killing machines... I will soon hold dominion over this realm. / Is Andre here yet? What's my motivation? / Rar. / Do I have time to purge before the next sene? / / And so, Evil Jon learns what the rest of us already knew: no matter what the dimension, evil or good, Brooke Shields is a talentless, useless, vapid waste of skin. / C'mon. Ice cream's on me. http://www.goats.com/archive/990326.html

You want to raise cows. In our apartment. / Not just any cows. Kobe beef cows. / / Kobe beef is a delicacy... the price people pay for the stuff is astronomical.

Are you sure? http://www.goats.com/archive/990407.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990408.html
You are so tense. / / Phillip. Either you can stay, or the cow can stay. But there isn't enough beer for you both. / Hm. What if I stay... and the cow also stays? / / Let me make this clear, Phillip.

http://www.goats.com/archive/990413.html
What's wrong? / Gertie... she's missing. We had a tiff, and she ran off. / / Sorry. Haven't seen her. / Diablo... what... what are you eating? / / Calm down. It's just a little Albanian refugee. Care for some? / Nah. Too stringy for my delicate palate. http://www.goats.com/archive/990413.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990414.html
I can't believe Gertie is gone. I've been rejected by a cow. / Bummer. / / A cow, Diablo. I didn't meet the standards of a methane-emitting food animal with the learning potential of a post-accident Gary Busey. How pitiful am I? / Way down there. / / I... I feel like Jon. / Oh, c'mon. It's not that bad. / Hey. http://www.goats.com/archive/990414.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990415.html
Where's the cow? Where is the beast? / We heard you had a cow. / / She's gone. Left for greener pastures. / Gone? It's gone? / Aw hell.

http://www.goats.com/archive/990419.html
I'm not surprised your cow ran off. This business plan is a mess. / It's a solid, brilliant plan. Raising kobe beef is very profitable. / / You have no clear source of revenue. You've already spent your projected profits on beer. And your entire adverstising budget is devoted to attacking Tara Lipinski with a crowbar to get your name in the paper. / Sounds like success to me. / / There's also this small bit where the cow gets eaten by Japanese businessmen. / If Gertie had a problem with that, she only had to say something to me. http://www.goats.com/archive/990419.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990420.html
So, how do we modify this business plan to make it work? / Ooh... I'll get a bunch of Bonobo monkeys for the apartment. We can watch them have sex. / / Bonobo monkeys. / Yeah. It'll be like the Playboy Channel. Except with monkeys. / / It must be difficult being such a visionary. / Not really. You just have to drink a whole lot. http://www.goats.com/archive/990420.html
 
http://www.goats.com/archive/990421.html
Now, working under the premise that watching monkeys have sex is a less-than-ideal way for any business to make a profit, let's continue. / / The most successful businesses, at least in terms of making suckers out of the public, have been internet companies. How can we use the internet to make our business profitable? / / Cow porn? / I was thinking "e-commerce," but let's not dismiss your idea outright. http://www.goats.com/archive/990421.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990422.html
So you want to sell cows over the internet. / Not necessarily cows... we can sell anything. Preferably something that people will buy. / / Monkeys! / No. Not monkeys. We need to think of something that lends itself to e-commerce the way that books and software do. / / Pre-moistened towelettes! / Now we're cookin' with gas. http://www.goats.com/archive/990422.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990423.html
How goes our little e-commerce venture? / I've bought a carton of moistened towelettes, and registered the "moistnap.com" domain. What else do we need? / / Maybe a chat room, so the moistnappies can talk amongst themselves. / Not bad. How about web-based email, too? / / Oh! And a Reuters newsfeed. And a homepage builder! / Good idea. Man, we are so bleeding-edge. http://www.goats.com/archive/990423.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990426.html
Check out our new slogan. / "Moistnap.com: The premier community portal destination site for moistened towelette users." / / I know, I know, it's brilliant, but a snappy slogan isn't going to rake in the money by itself. We need to come up with a way to push the moistened towelettes... a way to make them... you know, sexy. / / I could rub them against my naked thighs. / A pint of NyQuil isn't going to get me to sleep tonight. http://www.goats.com/archive/990426.html
http://www.goats.com/archive/990427.html
Shouldn't you be doing the programming for the Moistnap.com site? / Nah. I've got Jerrell doing most of the harder stuff. / / We don't have any operating capital.
