The MSG-plane only holds three. / We have to go, we're the title characters. / The third should be Mr. Disease so we can stay in touch with the entity. / I fear that the mind of the glutamate assists us only for its own ends. The Cornersheep and the Oval threaten its power. / So once we've defeated them... well, for now we don't have a choice. We have to stop the known villains. / Are we flying yet? I can't tell. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1171
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1172
Prepare for landing. / Already? We can't be over Scotland yet. / Yes, we can. / Oh, you're trying to get the Cartoonist to... oh no. I shouldn't have said anything. / Actually, you are over Scotland. The plane travelled through some of the higher-order dimensions I never draw. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1172
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1173
We should have formed a plan... / and taken equipment... / and gathered more intelligence... / and stuff. / The plan is thus to gather intelligence and equipment. / Or we could turn around. / No. Fight now. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1173
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1174
The plane's landing. Now there's no turning / into a giant robot? / No, back. / So we can turn into a giant robot? / Not that I know of. That sounds more like a Sentry thing. / It is not. The rhombus sat on the remote and inadvertently flipped channels between Iron Chef and Voltron. / I'll take that as a punchline. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1174
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1175
Outside the MSG-plane... / I'm not seeing any lair. / It must be underground. / Stumble aimlessly, there's probably a secret entrance nearby. / I'm on it. / Whoops, I just tripped over this... ordinary rock. Oh well, maybe next time. / Keep going, you'll do it. / Is there not a faster way in? Perhaps with explosions? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1175
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1176
Cartoonist! Any hints? / As long as Robert stays true to himself, the Oval will be defeated. / And the Cornersheep? / Don't worry about the Cornersheep. The Oval's the real threat. / What happens if Robert fails? / I don't know. Maybe this whole plot'll have been a dream or something. / Don't... you... dare. / Should I pretend I didn't hear any of that? / Your call. I'll just let you do your thing. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1176
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1177
While Robert attempts to penetrate the mysterious defenses of the Oval's hiding place, a situation arises back home. / The dome's down. The sheep will attack the city! / Three of us can't defend a city, even against sheep. / We need a force to lead. / Perhaps. Perhaps not. I should attempt the Fondue. / Gasp! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1177
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1178
You have the recipe. That doesn't mean you have the skill. / How do you know the recipe anyway? Who wrote it? What is the purpose of the Fondue of Four Thousand Cheeses? / I don't know. Maybe I'll find out if I make it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1178
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1179
I think I can convince the RDCLBA to organize a defense against the sheep. / Do that. / Will you help me prepare the Fondue? / I can't think of anything more productive to do. / One lengthy recipe recitation later... / I know where to get most of those cheeses, but are you sure Venezuela even has beavers? / No. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1179
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1180
Mr. Pyramid, if we can still call you that... / You may. / The RDCLBA is not a military organization. / You're a letting-sheep-take-over-the-city organization? / We could cover up the fact that the sheep are invading... Would that help? / How could that possibly help? / Well, if the sheep don't know they're invading, they wouldn't be much of a threat, right? ... Well, that's the best I've got. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1180
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1181
Listen up! The RDCLBA has a job to do! Just because the government has been disbanded by sheep doesn't mean we can't do something! / We lost a lot of polygons in the Cube disaster, and I know the agency hasn't really recovered. That doesn't change the task at hand. This city will soon be attacked by ovine forces. We won't stand a chance in direct combat. We need to divert them. / And then what? / We can only hope that the Oval will be defeated in Scotland and the sheep will be pulled back. It's not much of a hope, I know. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1181

[[sign: NOT / TO CITY]] / Baa? / Baa. / Great, that bought some time. They're bound to catch on at some point, though. We need to keep it up. / What if we paint the outskirts of the city pink? / Where could we possibly find that much pink? Color is not an option. / What if... we write the word "pink" on all the buildings? If the sheep continue to be this dumb that'll be enough. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1182
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1183
How'd you do with your half of the cheese list? / I found most of them. / Same here. What are you missing? / A few sheep's milk, and mild cheddar. / You couldn't find cheddar? / I think it's just the Cartoonist trying to force us into a Monty Python reference. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1183
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1184
Here we have gathered three thousand nine hundred seventy-eight cheeses. / Seventy-nine, I found the cheddar. / I can make nineteen of the remainder with a lactating sheep and some power tools. The last two could be a problem. / I don't have your memory. Which two? / Aged parmesan, minimum six hundred years, and farmer's cheese pasteurized on a winter solstice. / I know! I'll be right back. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1184

I know this is an unusual request, but the situation is desperate. I wish to remove relics from the crypt. / You? Is that... really you? You've grown quite a lot. / What? Do you know me from somewhe... ... Master Basil? What are you doing here? / I'm just a gravetender now. My chef days are well behind me. / I'm the Vegetable Sentry now, Master Basil. I've never forgotten what you taught me. / Sentry? You? What happened? / It was a long time ago. I would have told you if I had known where you were. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1185

Where is he? Cheese waits for no polygon. / He met an old teacher of his. They're catching up on old times. / But the cheeses... he can't afford to waste time! / You haven't even begun to milk any sheep.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1187
I was with her when she died. She... she choked on a scallion. That's no death for a Sentry. / She would bolt her food. That was her one great weakness. / She gave me her spatula. I didn't want to take it. I knew there had to be someone who would make a better Vegetable Sentry than myself. / Then why... / She threw it at me with her last tablespoon of strength. It was in contact with me at the moment her spirit departed her body. I still think it was the wrong choice, but I've tried my best. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1187
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1188
I can't just let you into the crypt. Fight me. I expect you'll win. / No, Master Basil. I'll find another way to what I seek. / Tell me then, what did you hope to find in the crypt? / Rare cheeses. The Dairy Sentry is attempting the Fondue of Four Thousand Cheeses. I need ancient Parmesan, and farmer's cheese pasteurized on a winter solstice. / How ancient? / Aged 600 years. / Is that all? That, I can grant you as a gift from my own salad toppings. As for the farmer's cheese... seek elsewhere. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1188

Sheep cheeses underway. / Parmesan acquired. I'm not sure about the farmer's cheese. / That's what SHE said! / Huh? / Huh? / Sorry. / I'll take no chances. Gather all ingredients before beginning preparation. / Yes, but how? No one marks farmer's cheese my date of pasteurization... at least... not consciously... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1191
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1192
Where'd Vegetable go? / How should I know? / ...I'm supposed to be writing it... / Yes. / I'm not here to hurt you, but I'm running out of patience! Give me your time sheets for the week of the solstice! / Bring it on. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1192
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1193
I know you pasteurized a shipment on the 12th. Who handled it? / That's none of your business, Sentry. / Remember, I asked nicely. / No! Bad idea! BAD i... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1193
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1194
The Vegetable Sentry just died. / Are you sure? What happened? / He performed a sort of drill stomp attack in a dairy processing plant, went through the floor, and detonated a fermentation tank. / No. / A dairy explosion can't have killed him. / It could have if that's what the plot required. The cartoonist / {{bottom half of the panel has been scribbled out}} http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1194
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1195
What are you doing? What's this for? / I don't want you to give away the plot. / {{bottom half of the panel is scribbled out}} / It's okay to speculate, but I'd like the readers to do their own speculating independently. / This is new. / What speculating? All I said was it's obvious you're killing off the four sentries. / That's not speculation, that's a solid fact. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1195
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1196
Okay, okay. The plot as I have it envisioned does call for some number of dying Sentries. / That doesn't mean they'll die. The plot's gotten away from me on more that one occassion. / The Fondue must be what you're planning to kill the Dairy Sentry with... What'll kill the Grain Sentry? / My guess is an RDCLBA loose cannon. / Oh, you're no fun anymore. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1196

If I leave here to get the final cheese, all the cheese I've collected might be tampered with. / Carry it. / How? / Telekinesis. / I don't have that. / You did when you were an inverted capital G. I don't believe the Starham took away any of your abilities. / I've had energy beams all this time? That would have been handy to know. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1198
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1199
Cheeses, arise! / (Energy beams. Honest.) / That wasn't even hard. Now to collect the final cheese and being the Fondue. / (Still an energy beam, but now it's acting sort of like a kite string.) / I saw the pasteurization plant explode and figured you could use help. How many cheeses to go? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1199
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1200
One cheese. Farmer's. Pasteurized on winter solstice. / If I bring samples, can you date them? / I don't swing that way. / That's not what I meant. / I realized that right after I said it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1200
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1201
If I bring samples of cheese, can you date them? / Not to the necessary precision. / What sort of precision do we need? / Within a one day window. / And that was the city's only pasteurization plant, so there's nowhere left to get records. / I'm not giving up! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1201
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1202
You're not meant to make the Fondue, Bark. It's fate. / You still believe in fate? / If there ever was a fate, it's dead now. Things don't happen for a reason. They don't even happen by chance. It's all the whim of the Cartoonist. / Then it's the Cartoonist that doesn't mean for you to find the last cheese. Same thing, pratically speaking. / Don't give the Cartoonist that much credit. He changes his mind every strip. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1202
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1203
Incoming! / I've got it. / What is it? / A conveniently dated barrel of farmer's cheese. Told you so. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1203
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1204
That's a lot of cheese to be levitating. / I'll set it down when we're ready. / Ready how? / We need a medium seventy-gallon saucepan and something to heat it over. / A... an antique washtub and some sort of smelting furnace? / That'll work. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1204
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1205
I sense a disturbance. / A disturbance in something, or just a disturbance in general? / No! He wouldn't be that stupid! / Who? / The Dairy Sentry. The Fondue is being prepared. / Chalk him up as dead... That leaves Mr. Disease and the Grain Sentry. / Robert, that's only if the Fondue doesn't actually destroy all life on this planet. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1205
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1206
The Fondue could really destroy {{sideways}}all... / Robert? / I found the entrance! I just just needed to be distracted a little to stumble into it. / So you're okay? / What? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1206

I'm in a narrow cement tunnel with metal supports on the walls. It curves out of sight in both directions. / Inventory! / I am carrying: the ten of diamonds, a lithograph of a pony, an instruction manual, sixteen cents, a mysterious toupee, a cotton satchel, and tea. / Examine the manual. / The word "Hydlide" is prominently displayed on the cover. / BURN IT! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1207

Now that I have a light source, I can make out a trail of hoofprints. / LOOK AT TRAIL. / The prints are uniformly ovine. The trail is well-worn from regular traffic.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1209
I don't understand you! / Maybe you should come down here so we don't have to shout back and forth! / Go on! I will stand watch outside. / How long have you been standing next to me? / That is not important. / I was just wondering. / Go, Triangle! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1209

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1211
Robert... I'm... alive? / Of course you're alive. You barely fell one screen. / With the Cartoonist on a killing spree, I'd have though that would be enough. / It wasn't. / They followed the tunnel north. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1211
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1212
[[Yellow background]] / We did it. / I am the Fondue of Four Thousand Cheeses. What is your desire? / No offense intended, Dairy, but I find myself desperately wishing that this made sense. / That is beyond my power. / I wasn't talking to you. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1212

[[Yellow background]] / There must have been Prozac in the sheep's milk. / Can you unmake the Fondue? / What are you two talking about? / No. It can't stay fresh forever, though. / So we can try to ride it out? / Let's sing a song! / Yay!

Robert! What's that up ahead? / It's a door. What, you forgot what doors look like? / Why are you being snippy? / Snippy? It's called witty banter. / There's nothing witty about it. / Since when are you the supreme arbiter of funny? / What? Did you suddenly turn into a jerk, or have I just me, I don't want to understand the nature of the universe. / Come back, mortal! It grows so lonely with none to tell my story to.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?846
Mr. Disease knocked down a wall, but the Sentries didn't wake up... so I'm gonna knock down some more walls until they do! / Robert... Mr. Disease only knocked down the wall that was keeping the Sentries out of each others' lines of sight. / Are you trying to tell me something? / We're going home, Robert. And no, you can't keep the forklift. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?846

Ferrets were never a part of this conversation. / Hi! I'm Prozac the Bear! / We are aware of that.

The Starbone was destroyed, wasn't it? / I don't think it was. / The physical bone may have been shattered or even pulverized, but the Starham's power would not have been broken so easily. / So we have to find the remains and reforge it? / I'm not sure about the reforging part. It'd be easier to just use it in a stew. / ...and again the sudden and unremarked emergence of seeming wackiness. / Huh? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?848
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?849
I find myself about to ask a question of you which will almost certainly lead to a zany answer. / We need to magnetize a pig. / How are we possibly going to find the remnants of the... oh. Um, may I asked another? / Of course. / How does one magnetize a pig? / Rub it sideways against a magnetized cow. / Oh. How... / You use a magnetized horse. / But... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?849
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?850
You magnetise the horseshoes and ride it around a while. / Oh. / What if you made magnetic pigshoes? / Skipping the larger animals... efficient, if it's feasible. / More or less meanwhile, in another plot... / Then you can just put the ferret in any still body of water and it'll point north! / Please leave. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?850
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?851
Fridge magnets and... a staple gun? / It'll work, won't it? / I suppose we can try. / So how do we get the pig to run around? / I think the staple gun will solve that problem as well. / Comic cruelty to animals. Very traditional. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?851
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?852
[[A pigtail can be seen moving off the right side of the panel]] / I think it's working. / So how do we get the pig to stop running around? / I think we'll have to rely on the staple gun once more. / This could get disgusting. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?852
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?853
Watch your aim. / I know. If we will the pig we won't get our deposit back. / You rented the pig? / Yeah. / I didn't know they stayed open this late. / I think it's because of the holidays. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?853
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?854
Kapow! Kapow! Pig immobilized. / With any luck it should be polarized enough to attract the Starham. / This white power on its flank must be dust from the bone of the Starham. / It's not much. Will you be able to make a stew with that? / I'll be able to try. Go return the pig now so we won't forget and get his with a fine. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?854
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?855
This pig's magnetized. / Is that a problem? / $5 extra. / I'm early. If I demagnetize it myself and come back will there still be a fine? / Go right ahead. / Wait, sir? You forgot your punchline! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?855
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?856
And so, Robert has 24 hours to demagnetize and return a magnetized rental pig. / No problem. I just need to get to a good centrifuge. / "No livestock"... that's new.

It is essential that you remember word for word. / When the ferret is rising, six ferrets shall turn it back, three from the ferret and three from the other, slightly smaller, ferret, in the land of Marmot where the ferrets lie.

It's not livestock, really! It's... / Calm down. / The sign's there to keep the local hooligans from cow-rotating. I know you, you're responsible.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?859
Stew smells good. / Did you return the pig? / Naturally. / So, explain to me the theory behind this stew. / The bone healed the Sentries before, I'm hoping it'll do it again. / That's it? / Nothing to do with... ferrets? / No, of course not. Why? / Nothing, really. Just a passing thought. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?859

No, "tariff" spelled backwards would be "ffirat". Now please, please listen to me. / Is that Welsh? / Is what Welsh? / Ffirat. / No. It's not Welsh. It's not anything. / Are you positive? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?861

Using his awesome lack of telepathic powers, Robert fails to command a nearby school of ferrets to come to his aid. / Meanwhile, in a hospital the name of which I have yet to determine... / (Saline bags... stew... without Robert to interfere this will be trivial.) / Curiously enough, it is indeed trivial, and as the Starham stew courses through the blood vessels of four comatose Sentries its effects are almost immediately visible. / Yay! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?868
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?869
Encased in his meaty and immobile exorectangle, Robert makes a startling discoverey. / (The taste of potted meat is not wholly pleasant.) / That's not the discovery. / (This doesn't all taste like potted meat. There are patches of... something tangy.) / Right, that's the one. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?869

Robert, I'm back... Robert? / Robert's gone! / Huh? / He's vanished, leaving behind a Robert-shaped cavity in the potted meat! / I'll take your word for that. / You can't tell? Hm... oh yeah. I get it. Right. White background, white shape... cute. He's definitely gone, though. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?871

I'm not dead. I've been dead and this isn't it. / Thus, I cannot logically be in the afterlife. / So why are the backgrounds all goofy and mock-surreal? Why are there backgrounds at all? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?873
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?874
The rectangle is unbroken. Robert wasn't broken out... that implies teleportation. / The question then becomes: did he teleport out, or was he teleported out? / I'm more concerned with destination than motive. / The question then becomes: where? / You're just typing to see yourself talk now. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?874
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?875
This isn't gratuitous background junk. It has a scent. / Wandering aimlessly around a pointlessly decorated landscape which may or may not be the afterlife is awfully dull. / The cartoonist's attempts to liven it up by messing around with dithering only make the situation more depressing. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?875

The potted meat was tampered with! / Chosen one! Do you require my aid? / You're a) conscious, b) ambulatory and c) following me? / Whatever you added to our IVs acted quickly! I awakened sensing meat-related distress, so I pursued. / Meat-related distress? Since when have you been able to sense that?

Tell me about your past, miss Concarne... if that's your name, I mean... / It is. / Well, explain some things to me. How did you become the Meat Sentry? How did you forget? Why did you join the ICI? Who, in short, are you? / I'm the Meat Sentry. Details can come later. / They can, but they won't. I know how this strip works, the Cartoonist won't let any harm come to Robert while someone's giving exposition.

You claim to have sensed my "meat-related distress", and yet you failed to recognize the meat-based solution which was entering your body intravenously. / Uh... uh... / My fault.

I can explain my actions, but I can't excuse them. Don't take me with you if you don't trust me, but at least listen to my observations. / I suppose. / Note the tangy patches on the potted meat. / What tangy patches? / You have blinded yourself with self-reliance, Chosen One. Well, not blinded, per se, but the gustatory equivalent thereof. / That would have sounded better if you'd stopped after "Chosen One". http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?880

Perhaps your skill is great, but you still must have allies. Do not discount my potential... or Robert's. / Robert's? / He is not only a friend. He is a sidekick. You should not hold him back. His aid has benefitted you before and is likely to do so again. / You wouldn't be here to say that if he'd kept me from administering that stew! / You would have succeeded eventually. There was no call for haste. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?881

You know, you talk... big. We couldn't fit a punchline last strip. / Force of habit. / I did a lot of shouting in the Meat Enforcers. / Is there any chance you could turn it down?

[[Robert is drawn with a dotted line]] / You haven't pretended to go insane again, so this isn't a mock-up of your psyche.... / It's not precisely the afterlife....

You're right. I was so sure of myself I never stopped to taste the plot thickening around me. If you can tell where Robert is, lead me to him. / Sure thing! / Portally! / And meanwhile... / I know! Let's try it this way. A dark ferret has begun to creep over this land, and ancient ferrets have long spoken of an outsider who would come and rejoin the three ferrets of... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?884
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?885
So I should start by climbing to the peak of the Ferret of the Distant Gods and pulling from the stone the ferret I find there! Why didn't you say so? / Well, yes, but... this is a MAGIC ferret. It'll look more like a sword than a ferret, actually. Almost exactly like a sword. / Not a problem. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?885

Robert! / Triangle! You came! / Robert? Where are you? / What order are these panels in? / What panels? / What kind of portal was that? / A... very confusing one? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?886
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?887
Okay, so now where are we? / I can answer that. / Robert! You're here! / I was here last strip too. / Yes, but here wasn't here. / Well, it is now. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?887

We can't get to Aruba and back before Linda's temporary MSG body collapses. / No, probably not. Do we know anyone who can? / I have no idea, there are too many characters in this strip. / There must be some way. Perhaps the other Sentries know of something. / We could try the Fondue of Four Thosand Cheeses again. / I lack the vocabulary required for a sufficiently enraged reply. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1259
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1260
If the Fondue is Linda's only chance, we have to go for it. / It's not her only chance. With the sheep fled I can fly a plane there. / Oh. / I'll start measuring the cheeses in case you don't make it. / I'd rather you didn't. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1260

The Oval was never meant to return. Naturally they'd have manned it with an expendable automaton and not a human. / But if it wasn't human, why were polygons required to obey it? / They built the Ovalnaut with all their command of geometry so that it could deal with unexpected situations. / That almost vaguely makes sense. Over the centuries it forgot what it was, and assumed it must have been human because it had the abilities of humans? / Limbs in particular. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1262

We will be landing now. / I wonder if we'll be heroes. / I hope not. / I thrive on inconsequential adventures that change nothing. / I have enough to worry about being a protagonist.

We just got a letter, we just got a letter, we just got a letter, wonder who it's from! / Just open the thing. / A desperate theme park wants to hire us to turn them around! / That sounds good. / Oh... they mean turn them around financially, not rotationally. Still, a job's a job. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1264
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1265
Well, this is it. / Doesn't look like much. / Not being drawn isn't helping it. / Doesn't sound like much either. A theme park should have annoying music and... forget I said anything. / Forget wha-? Oh. We don't want to risk... that pill... thinking we want it here. / It certainly smells like a theme park, on the plus side. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1265

You've arrived. Welcome to... well, we're between names at the moment. Naming this park is one of the tasks for you to handle. / We had trouble finding the place. You need to give better directions and put up a few signs. / At one point the park was "Impossible-to-Find World" and hidden under a tarp. We haven't entirely undone that. / So you've been through a lot of themes? / There's been a tendency to jump on bandwagons at just the wrong moment. / Hence "All Your Coaster Are Belong To Us." http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1266

The first thing people see after the parking lot is the entrance. It should be welcoming and exciting. / And drawn. / Ideally, yes. / Drawn or not, though, there should be almost no barbed wire. / You see?

Look at these ticket prices. They make no sense.

Anything else you could suggest about the entrance? / Not until we have a name for the park.

Are you just going to leave your partner stuck on the barbed wire? / It's the safest place for him to be. / Don't let him down until we've identified all the deathtraps and potential self-destruct mechanisms.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1271
We have forty-four rides, although they're not all currently functioning.... Are you sure Robert is okay like that? / You're the client. If you want him down I'll let him down. / Remember, you did sign an insurance waiver. / Hi, I let myself down from the barbed wire. Did you know this theme park was built over an isosceles burial ground? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1271
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1272
What do you mean, an isosceles burial ground? / Back when discrimination against them was more blatant, isosceles triangles had to bury their dead separately from scalene triangles. A lot of them died violent deaths. I'd be surprised not to encounter vengeful spirits. / Robert, don't be silly. There's no such thing as competent ghosts. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1272
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1273
Cotton candy! Cotton candy! / Fibreglass insulation... / Robert, what... no... how are you eating that? Don't eat fibreglass! / It's not fibreglass. / Why are there giant rolls of pink cotton candy amongst janitorial and maintenance equipment? / We had to put them somewhere. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1273
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1274
Triangle, I think I ate too much cotton candy. / I noticed. / It did give me an idea, though. I know exactly how we can catch that spooky crook. / What spooky crook? / I'm ahead of the plot. Sorry. / This isn't Scooby! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1274
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1275
There are lots of things that happen in amusement parks, not just Scooby Doo episodes. / In fact, there aren't even that many amusement park episodes of Scooby Doo. / ... / You say "Jinkies," I eviscerate you. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1275

Let's try a ride. / I guess it can't hurt. / Feel free. / What's that one? "The Permutatron"? / It's out of order. / We can get a good view of the park from the Ferris wh... tetrahedron? / How does that even rotate? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1276
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1277
Riding the Ferris tetrahedron after overeating is inadvisable. / Here I go! / Why did he just... / Officially, he's stress- and safety-testing the ride. Unofficially, it's just so he gets to vomit. / Does he enjoy vomiting? / No. He's just trying to advance the plot. Or something. I don't think he knows either. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1277
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1278
Whee! / The Ferris tetrahedron looks fun. Except, um... / Shouldn't it be structurally impossible for it to, you know... / Sh! Don't say... / The collapse of the Ferris tetrahedron was oddly silent, as I wasn't really sure what kind of noise it should make. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1278
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1279
W... why... why would you have.... a ride... which IMMEDIATELY falls apart if anyone questions its mechanical viability? / I have no idea. / Aren't you in charge? / I've only been in charge for three weeks. This is the first time I've seen the park operating in person. / And this wasn't worth telling us before because... / I didn't want you to be underconfident. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1279
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1280
So far I'm thinking you should dismcessible only to the Watcher, Orpuddex. / The existence of the Factory, until that point, was an obscure legend, one of thousands of mythical threats. When the legend was proven true, we Sentries struck. However... we were unprepared. We had each fought separately, furthering the causes of our own food group. As a team, we were untrained, and so against the Pudding-Watcher we were helpless. / sentence tomorrow / Cube said that Orpuddex's presence in normal space was a sign of the Time of the Oval. / It may very well be. That is one prophecy which was lost even to us Sentries. The cube knows many secrets more ancient than even our First Recipes. / So, did the Cartoonist's vvvvvvvvvcffffffffffffffttttttttttttttttttttttt / Uh... I spilled tegfa on my keyboagfrd... you'll hagfve to inish thagft http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?909
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?910
So did the Cartoonist's presence trigger the Time of the Oval, or did the Time of the Oval cause the Cartoonist to begin the strip? / I don't know. That might be a false dichotomy. / In any event, the emergence of the Pudding-Watcher from his hiding led us to attack. We lost, and he devoured our memories. / And you all reacted differently... the Dairy Sentry started thinking he was a letter and physically changed into one, the Grain Sentry started a new life as the Food Pyramid... / We each had our reasons. I dimly recalled my role as a defender of meat... but I had forgotten the Sentries, and the closest job I found was that of Meat Enforcer. / But surely, you recognized them as evil before long? / No. It looks different from the inside. And... / I know. Don't call you Shirley. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?910
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?911
So then, once your memories were restored, you all went for the Factory again. / The first time we attacked, the Vegetable Sentry was absent. We thought that with all four of us combined, we would have no trouble. / Why wasn't the Vegetable Sentry with you the first time? / He had suffered a defeat and was meditating. You know that. / I do? / It was many strips ago that he spoke to you about the matter. Perhaps you should peruse the archives If your memory needs refreshing. / We had thought he would respond to our call, but he was too deep in thought. Then, when we were defeated, he absorbed some of the psychic shock and his meditation turned into a coma. / From which I awoke him in Denmark. So that's why he still had his memories, and why he didn't know where the rest of you were. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?911
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?912
So, to put it in a less flattering light, the excitement of discovering that the Pudding-Watcher was real distracted you from realizing how pathetic he is now. / I suppose that might be the case. / Don't go chasing after him unless he starts to do something both evil and competent. You're no use unconscious. / I suppose. / Hey Triangle, is the exposition over now? / Yeah, you can bring in the can-can zebras. / They exploded. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?912
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?913
If the can-can zebras exploded, what are we going to do about the next plotline? / I think it's Cube's turn. / And so it is. / Another refill? / No. I'm done. / You have... completed the paper? / Yup. All I have to do now is fax it to a few journals and maybe put it on USENET and then I won't be worth killing anymore. / My telecommunications facilities are at your disposal. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?913
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?914
It's sent. I am no longer in need of your protection. Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Disease. / It is not in the way of a warrior-chef to deny hospitality to a customer. / You kept refilling everything for me, even after days. Nothing in your code requires free seconds on main courses or hot beverages. Why did you go so far out of your way to help me? / I must know what transpired in the city of Tetris. Your story will fill many gaps in the warrior-chef tradition. / Oh. / Also, the Locust Garden's continued appearances in the comic strip are surprisingly good for business. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?914
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?915
Cartoonist! I've held up my end. / So you have. By your actions, much knowledge formerly lost is now within the domain of polygons. / And as for your end? / You will be beyond my ability to be harmed. It is a simple process. Remember that though you have eight vertices, I draw but seven. / So? / Make a mark upon your hidden vertex, and keep the nature of the mark hidden to me. Any of the ancient scripts I don't have a font for will do. I will then be unable to draw you from an arbitrary angle, and so will have no power over your life and death. / What an incredible load of bezier crap. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?915
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?916
I draw you from the other side in the afterlife. Look at the archive if you don't believe me. / This sounds very tenuous. / It is. If I really wanted to kill you, I still could. The point is that, since we've spent strips negotiating this deal, the readers would know if I deliberately broke it. If I deliberately go back on my word, the whole strip falls apart. / The Gospel According to Kevin Smith? / Dogma? Yeah, sort of like that. And I can't kill you accidentally, since you'd be ejected from the afterlife for non-drawability. / How can I be sure my spirit will have the mark, not just my body? / Use really good ink. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?916
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?917
Cube, your conclusions, though they contradict much of what I believed myself to learn, are inescapable. / If I'd been thinking on the right track the peppermill would have been the only clue I needed. / How were you to know? / That's true. / Hey, if you're gonna keep alluding to Cube's findings instead of explaining them, let me know so I can cut to another scene. / Sorry, force of habit. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?917
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?918
The peppermill was powered by nothing more or less than geometry itself. The Fourth Race harnessed geometry as a tool, and constructed great wonders by using it. / I know. I read your paper already. / This is for the benefit of the readers. / Oh, of course. I apologize. / When the Fourth Race died out, their creations continued to grow and change. We, the Seventh Race, are the distant descendants of these geometric devices. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?918
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?919
The saying that the meek would inherit the earth dates back to the Fourth Race, and so it came to pass that the Fifth Race evolved from the Fourth Race's very symbol of humility. / ...Baa. / Yes. I do not understand the lack of an ovine archaeological stratum, but the Fifth Race was undoubtedly of sheep, and reigned for a great deal of time. / What about the Sixth? / I have found nothing at all to fill that gap. Between intelligent sheep and polygons came a sentient species about which I have learned nothing beyond its existence. / And so the quest for knowledge must continue. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?919
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?920
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCORECARD / First Race: unknown* / Second Race: unknown / Third Race: unknown / Fourth Race: Man / Fifth Race: intelligent sheep / Sixth Race: unknown / Seventh Race: polygons / Eighth Race: unknown / * (Puddans?) / I could tell you who the Sixth Race was without affecting the plot, but you either wouldn't believe me or'd get mad. / I thought it might be something in that category. / As for why the Fifth left no record, all the clues for that are in the strip. Let me know if you really can't figure it out. / Why do you insist on making my life a puzzle game? / It's that or Sokoban. / Sokoban's also a puzzle game. / Whatever. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?920
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?921
You listed the Eighth Race on that archaeological scorecard thing. / You know why. It's the Time of the Oval. / How much time do we have? / I can't answer that. It's not set in scone. / But the time for polygons on this world is nearing its end. / All things are nearing their ends, at different rates. / Can't you stop being cryptic for one whole conversation? / I am. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?921
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?922
So what exactly is the significance of the Oval? / You haven't been paying attention? / I've been paying attention... you explains what it means that the Oval is here, but what is the Oval itself? / Well, you see, the archaeological record of the Fourth Race is in some points very / Ah. / What do you mean, "ah"? / You don't know. / It's not a matter of not knowing, so much as... the evidence... being... / Ah. / ... ah. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?922
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?923
Well? / Well what? / What was in the envelope? / The... hey, yeah. Where'd it go? / I'm saving it for a later plotline. / I was holding it! You can't just... I mean, you can, but you... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?923

The Cornersheep reads of Cube's findings. / Sheep controlled the Earth once before. / My flock rebelled against me, but with this document as inspiration I can gather a new flock, a flock untied not only by my power but also by an awareness of manifest ovine destiny! / The Fifth Race shall rise again.

Day {{sym: Libra/sublimation}} Finally reached planet. Descended. Sighted two local lifeforms, polygons both. Each was larger than the Oval. / Taller of two lifeforms took hold of the Oval and sat on it for some time. They argued.

Day {{sym: Libra + square snowflake}} The pudding-based lifeform having previously departed, the Oval was alone when the sheep mining operation appeared. / This world's sheep [this time's sheep, if this is indeed Earth] are polygon-based and distinctly quadrilateral. One, apparently a leader, exhibited telepathic abilities. This sheep had the Oval brought to the surface for examination. / Once removed from the pudding, the Oval's engines soon restored themselves to working order. The sheep fired various weapons at the Oval during my escape. No significant damage was done. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?928
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?929
Day {{sym: Libra + frown ampersand}} Taking readings of the interior of a vast building referred to by locals as the International Culinary Institute, the Oval encountered a polygon warning it to flee. Uncertain of the local political situation, I took this advice at face value. / After a head start during which this polygon had a heated conversation with two others, it gave chase. The Oval ran out of fuel and was captured. / Apparently a group called the RDCLBA had been offering a bounty of some sort for the Oval, but it had since been rescinded. Released, the Oval soon refueled (the availability of compatible fuel is further evidence that this world is Earth) and returned to orbit to make observations from safety. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?929
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?930
Day {{sym: Libra + diamond scissor}} Observations complete. This is, undoubtedly, a world where simple polygons evolved from man. / It's stupid. It's just... plain... stupid. / These shapes are unfit to rule a planet. I know what I must do in order to save the Earth. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?930
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1111
I hope you do know how to lead a scouting party. / Marshmallows on sticks, hot dogs, and lots of graham crackers, mostly. / Good. Organize one and see if there are any sheep forces en route. I'll supply the uniforms and merit badges. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1111
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1112
Just the two of us? / I was considering Mr. Disease, but well... / But well what? / We'd probably start arguing about something and lose track of the mission. / I thought you to got along. / We do, are long as we both have the Meat Sentry to argue with. / ...so any actual teamwork on the part of the Sentries is purely coincidental? / It's seemed that way since the Starham.... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1112
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1113
None of us can trust the other four. Our food groups embody different philosophies. / When we first fought together against Orpuddex, the Vegetable Sentry didn't show up for the battle. When our memories were eaten, the Meat Sentry let herself become a tool of evil. I threatened to destroy the very foundations of our / power as the Food Pyramid. We still can't be sure Mr. Disease is even really a Sentry. The Dairy Sentry... there's just something weird going on with him. I think his time as Robert's housepet did something to his mind, I don't know what. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1113
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1114
Unless there were a whole lot of things that happened that weren't in the strip, you're overstating the situation. Sheep! / About eleven thousand servings' worth. / How many is that in actual sheep? / I have no idea and I'm not about to count them. / Mission complete. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1114
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1115
You've finished scouting? / Yes. The sheep are en route. / Why am I leader? / Well, the Sentries are following you because you're supposed to be the Chosen One of the Beforings, Robert is following you because he's the wacky sidekick, and I just figure it makes sense to follow the same polygon as everyone else as long as we're working towards the same goal. / And of course Prozac the Bear's just following me to be annoying. / Help me up, I collapsed under the weight of my last sentence. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1115
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1116
Hi! I'm Prozac the Bear! / And now you're going to go into an unnecessarily long "recap" monologue that really explains nothing. / Nope. I'm Prozac the Bear! / Oh. / I think this is the first time I ever didn't want to kill you. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1116

That mostly went well. / Mostly. / We attacked a little early, but the confusion only helped Robert and Linda sneak into the ranks. / Now it's up to them. / They were the only two who could pass as sheep. They'll have to succeed. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1118

Baaaa! Neither one of us is cut out for espionage. Sooner or later I'll do something wacky or you'll do something violent. / Baa! You have a point. / Baa? / Uh, baa. / Baa. / Baaaa. What did you just volunteer for? / Baa, I think. And keep your font size down. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1119

History books would later call the conflict between the forces of sheep and polygon the Zero Days War. (By which species the histories would come to be written, whether ovine, geometric, or something still stranger, I do not yet intend to reveal.) / During this time, however, there is another conflict which will have an effect on the fate of the Universe of Pudding. This conflict takes place within my mind, the mind of the Cartoonist, and it is a conflict of ideas. / Hello. My name is Drug-Coated Stent, but you can call me Arthur. / It is, in fact, a conflict of very stupid and bad ideas. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1120

Hi! I'm Prozac the Bear! / You are a redundant fool and I shall destroy you. / Please. Stop it. Stop it! I have... thingies... to thing! Make with the nice! / Stay out of it. This is my fight! / Who are you? / That's... exactly... what I've been trying to figure out! Who I am! / Well, how did you get in here? / Do you two know each other? / I...

Prozac the mighty Bear, teach me your ways so that I might be happy, or at least unhappy in a less boring way. / You would ask a boon of me, but first I must ask a quest of you. / Speak it, and if it is in my power it will be done. / You must gather for me all one hundred fifty Rashomon. / Right, I'm just going to look at you very very strangely now. / Gotta catch 'em all viewpoints are equally valid! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1123
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1124
Triangle! Hug me. / I'm pointy and you're relatively noncorporeal. Where have you been? / I wanted a sustaining plot that wouldn't need my direct intervention, so I was staying out of it.... but I LIKE meddling!

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1126
Aboard the ship... is it safe to narrate now? / I think so. / Aboard the ship, Linda and Robert have no difficulty blending in with the crew and the many sheep being transported, but are unable to gather any useful information. / I know you haven't narrated in a while, but try to control yourself! / Font size.... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1126

The faux sheep play a game to pass the time while shipboard. / Okay, what's 2001: A Space Odyssey minus Seventeen Again? / What? / Come on, you can get it. / I don't understand the question! / It's 1984. / See, you take the numbers... / Oh, okay... I think... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1127

Wait! Something's wrong. What's 13 minus 2.5? / 9.5. / Yes. Now, what's 9.5 plus 2.5? / Hey, that's only 12! / Yes. / Then either the Cartoonist hasn't been bothering to check his arithmetic, or... someone, or something, is tampering with the very laws of mathematics. / Can't it be both? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1129
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1130
Think grassy thoughts! / What? / Baa! Baa! / The Cornersheep's boarded the ship. Don't think about it! Just stay sheepish. He won't use his telepathy at full strength if he doesn't suspect anything. / Baa. / I hear narrating. The cartoonist's attention must be nearby. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1130

Hello. I figured it was time to check in on what the villains are doing. / We're doing quite well, thank you. / So what are you doing at sea? Shouldn't you be commanding from some base or other? / I felt it necessary to debrief these sheep in person. / Ah. Because they fought the Sentries? / Yes. Why, should I have some additional reason? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1131
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1132
What of the Sentries did you observe? / Baa. / Four, but not she of Meat? Describe to me this fifth. / Baa. / Him. So he has accepted his talents. But... then where is the Meat Sentry? / Baaaa! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1132

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1135
The Meat Sentry and the wacky rhombus are on board. Execute them. / Baa!? / They're in disguise. Look for a rhomboid sheep and a small sheep with an unusual aspect ratio. / Baa?? / I know what I'm talking about. They are too on board. / Baa... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1135

Oh, this should be interesting. / What? / Orpuddex is harvesting. / Harvesting souls for the Factory? / Yeah. I wonder what happens if he tries to harvest a Sentry. / I'm still a Sentry when I'm dead? / Technically, until there's a new Meat Sentry among the living. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1143
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1144
Come to me! / So that's what that door was for. / Yes, it is through this portal that I call upon the departed to serve me. / What have you done with it? Return the portal to me! / It's still there. I can fit more text by not drawing it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1144
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1145
Why have you come to this forsaken place, writer? / You're about to harvest Linda Concarne. I want to watch. / It has been long since I last was confronted with the soul of a Sentry. Indeed, if my memory does not fail me, the last was a Grass Sentry of the Fifth Race. / That spirit is still imprisoned within this Factory, though it has never served me. / Are there other Sentries within these walls? / Ummmmaybe. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1145
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1146
The hey? / Hello, Miss Concarne. / Welcome once again to the Pudding Factory of the Dead. / What do you intend to do with me? / Very little. Using you to power the Factory would be very foolish of me indeed. I intend simply to keep you out of the way. / Good luck! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1146

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1148
How... how many of you are there? / One hundred fifteen thousand eight twenty-one. / We've counted more times than you can imagine. / So many souls strong enough to resist Orpuddex... how many more must have succumbed? / About negative one hundred fifteen thousand. / What? / Few souls choose to join the Factory. / The Pudding-Watcher is far from persuasive. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1148
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1149
You're not all polygons, are you? / Why all the questions? / This is the Vat of Despair. You're supposed to be despairing. / Maybe later!

Cartoonist? / Sorry, you can't hear me from inside the vat. / Yes, I can! / I mean officially.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1151
I guess I'll just have to try it for myself and see if it works. / I summon Variety Meat Barrage! / Cartoonist? I can't tell if my cuisine-magic works if you don't draw anything. / ...zzz... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1151
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1152

I... Sentry. Old Sentry! You new Sentry? / Yes! I'm the current Meat Sentry! / "Meat"... flesh? Animal? / Well, yes.

I wouldn't know where to begin. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1156
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1157
Can a Sentry directly convert pudding into a less fundamental form of food without using life energy? / What, you don't know? / It's never come up. I figured I'd ask you. / The possibility of a direct conversion would hinge on the flavor of the pudding. What flavor is it? / What about despair-flavored? / No. It is impossible. However, I thank you for the warning of Miss Concarne's plan. She will get nowhere. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1157
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1158
So the Fifth Race had Sentries... how many? / Groups? As of my death, five groups. Grass, leaves, grass, other, and grass. / Three grass groups? / Reading language from you, I have words missing. Different kinds of grasses. / And everything edible other than grass and leaves was "other"? / No. Almost everything. Not pudding, salt licks, mind-energy-food. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1158
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1159
Tell me about the days of the Fifth Race. If I ever get out of this vat it might be useful knowledge to have. / I'm still not here, but isn't that request sort of out of character? / If I had thought instead of fighting I wouldn't be a ghost now. Maybe it's time I start learning things. / Baa? / Oh no... now the Grass knows about me and why he or she is suddenly rendered as a hexagon rather than a fluffy ghost with limbs and such.

Prozac the Bear is a force not worth tampering with! / doop BOOP doop BOOP doop BOOP doop / I refuse to be here for this. / The Cartoonist's power can restore me to life, even after all these millenia, and the key to harnessing that power lies in the one called the Bear. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1161
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1162
Hi! I'm Prozac the Bear! / It worked! It's really Prozac! / You must have some awfully good reason to call me. Hey, did you know you're a ghost and we're in a giant vat of despair-flavored pudding? / That's why I called you actually. / I don't like despair. Do you have any eights? / Eights? What are you talking about? / I thought we were playing Go Fish. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1162
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1163
So, what's up? / I wish to be restored to life. You have the power of the Cartoonist. It would cost you nothing to help me. / Okay! / You'll do it? Thank you! / So... what do I do? / You, um, you just sort of, how should I know? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1163
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1164
Are you alive yet? / No. / How about now? / No. What exactly are you doing? / I'm not doing anything. Why do you ask? / I take this is some kind of test thingie to see if I'm worthy to get a new body. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1164

This pudding's getting me down. I'm gonna take off. You coming? / Yeah.

You. / Me! / I don't know for whom to root here. / You have the spirit of the Grass Sentry with you. / I do? Really? / Put it back in the vat. / Okay. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1166
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1167
That Prozac... that bear... whatever it is... / It threw you back in the vat? / It's a useless abomination against nature! How could this Cartoonist allow such a thing to exist? / You're talking about the same cartoonist that made you a hexagon despite your predating the rise of polygonal life forms. / True. Has no one opposed the Cartoonist? / Not in any useful way. There are some well-organized protestors, but their actions can't{{obscured}} http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1167
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1168
I'm back. Linda's probably dead. / She is. The Cartoonist filled us in. We won't be getting her back until after defeating the Cornersheep. / The infiltration attempt was a total failure. Now what can we do? / We need to go to Scotland. Mr. Disease was saying he had a plan. / Did he make that antenna? / Yeah, out of disodium guanylate and disodium inosinate, I believe. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1168
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1169
What are disodium... thing... and the other thing? / From what I understand, they enhance MSG in the same way that MSG enhances meat. / I believe I have established a signal! Most of the entity's power is dedicated to maintaining the city dome, but it has some remaining consciousness. I will ask it to lower the dome and to use its power to take us to Scotland. / So... you should... go do that, instead of running around telling everyone about it. / If a seaplane of additives arrives, board it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1169
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1170
OK / And so, the MSG entity ceased its concentration and the rains came, washing away the dome which had been protecting the last city on Earth not under the control of the Cornersheep. / I can take three of your group to Scotland and the lair of your foe. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1170
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1051
The gaps between the Races are only a handful of millenia long. There's not enough time for evolution to start over from scratch. / I know. / Keep on translating. There's bound to be a good explanation eventually. / Cartoonist! Hint! / Call Robert. The three of you together can decipher the comic book. / You actually got a hint out of him? / It's always worth a try. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1051
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1052
Finally? / Yes. We are ready to attack. / It's an ambitious plan. / Conquest one nation at a time is too uncertain. I have at my disposal means to ensure that for at least one full day there will be effectively zero resistance. We must take the world then. / I believe I know of what secret weapon you speak. If it slows the polygons for even an hour, my command of the world's sheep will bring victory. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1052
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1053
Defense! / What? / As Mr. Disease and many others stared in shock, a dull white dome sprang up around the city. / Necessary. / What? / The developing mind of the world's monosodium glutamate has exerted itself to defend the Sentries and the Chosen One from the effects of the Oval's plan. / Must this become so complicated? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1053
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1054
There are no souls to harvest in the aftermath of the ovine conquest. The Oval's assault on the wills of polygonkind has left the minions of the Cornersheep in unquestioned command. / Except the dome. / Yes. Beneath the glutamic dome I can perceive nothing. No telepathy or cuisine can pass into the city. Presumably then, the city is safe for the moment, as is the Chosen One. / When the dome dissolves in the next rain, the protagonists are likely to find the world much changed. / They can do nothing. The time for the Seventh Race on this world has ended. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1054
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1055
... beyond space, and not particularly in the vicinity of time, either... / Phase Three may be complete. / May? / Either it is complete or it can never occur. The uncertainty is deafening. / All this was to be expected. / All outcomes are possible. Everything changes. Everything flows. / That is a quality of pudding. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1055
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1056
Hold on... the Cornersheep just took over the world? / Apparently. / So we're spending our birthday under a city-covering dome of MSG cut off from the world. / Also my mouse is acting up. / Happy birthday, Triangle. / Uh, yeah. Happy birthday, Robert. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1056
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1057
We still need to solve the mystery of the Oval, maybe more so now than before if we need to fight against it. / I agree. / Until the dome dissolves we can do little but study. / So let's call Robert. / I'll be right there. / The phone hasn't rung yet. Have you been peeking at the other panels? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1057
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1058
Oh, good. All three of you can fit in one panel. / Barely. / Robert, how much have you gotten from the comic book so far? / I'm not positive. I need some of the words to be sure. / Stop shuffling us around, this is the best we'll fit. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1058

Is this what changing resolutions feels like? / Could the caption be something like "Don't try this at home!"? / I'll never be cruel to a graphics card again. / So that'd be an H, and that's punctuation... yes! That'd make this panel... / When do I stop feeling misproportioned? / Take deep breaths and look at the horizon. / and then if... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1059
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1060
This is even worse! At least antialias me! / This is a semi-technical explanation of the Oval, this is a description of its course, and this is just a printing error! / Okay, you're not listening. / Is that good? / It's making sense. From here I can come up with a list of the Oval's intended capabilities. / Single pilot. Not intended to return to Earth. Capable of instantaneously transmitting data to Earth, but limited to the speed of sound in pudding for reception. Equipped with automated geometric tools for general-purpose defense and troubleshooting. Stasis armor prevents all damage. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1060
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1061
Is the Oval intelligent, or just its pilot? / It wasn't intelligent when it was built. Who can say now? / The Cartoonist could. / It's not important. / You don't know. / I haven't decided yet. I don't think it'll matter. / How can we know what we're up against if you haven't even decided? / So I'm fuzzy on a few details. Most of it makes sense anyway. / What's the point of archaeology when you're not done writing the past yet? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1061
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1062
Okay, the Oval itself is of approximately the same intelligence as a Tetrean philosopher automaton, but without the more critical flaws and entirely subservient to the Ovalnaut. / Okay, in that case who's / The Oval has acted as a translator, but everything said was initiated by the pilot. / Humans are mortal. How is the pilot still alive? / I already explained the whole time distortion thing! If you don't get it, reread those strips. I'm not going through it with you again. / Oh, that stuff. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1062
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1063
None of this explains how it could have conquered the Earth. What's the secret weapon? / That I haven't figured out yet. / So have we learnt anything directly useful? / Well, not for the current situation, no. / Right. It's all been a complete waste of time. / I wouldn't go that far.... / Quiet, I'm on a roll here. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1063
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1064
What do you mean you're on a roll? / I mean, I mean... uh... I mean... / What do you mean? Bread? / What did you say? / Bread? / Bread... as in sandwich... as in ham sandwich! Ensign, bring up the strip archive! / Ensign? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1064
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1065
We've seen indications that the Ovalnaut ate the starham. What powers would this have granted? / How should I know? I'm not a nutritionist. / The Sentries don't know either. Who can we ask? / Not me. You've used up all your magical cheat juice. / Where can we get more magical cheat juice? / I wasn't being literal. / There's some way I can use that fact to trap you, right? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1065
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1066
Bacopocalypse! / Hibachi! / Juicex! / It's not working. Our magic can't break through the MSG dome. We can only wait for rain. / No... I have it. Think, all of you! What is the first nutrient? / Pudding? / Marshmallows? / Pork? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1066
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1067
Are you fools? What are the byproducts of puddic decomposition? / Lumps? / Solid. / Methane. / Gaseous. / ...Energy? / Water! Water is a nutrient, the most basic nutrient of all! / We need not wait for the rain if we can command it using the cuisine-magic! / Rain falls down from the sky! The sky's on the other side of the dome! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1067
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1068
What is there to prevent us from creating a rain on the inside of the dome, directed outwards? / I'll get a firehose. / I was thinking we could use cuisine-magic.... / But I know we can use a firehose. / Um, no, that won't work because, uh... the dome's too thick! Right! There isn't enough water available! You have to wait until it rains! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1068
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1069
I know, we tunnel under the dome! / Just wait for it to dissolve! What's so hard about that? / Cube must know where we can get some excavation equipment. / Or you could wait a few days and let the problem solve itself. / The Chosen One is impulsive. / And that's a bad thing? / No. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1069
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1070
Is Cube here? / Yes, he is. You know, those protestors sort of have a point. / I know. / Where can I get excavation equipment? / What powers are granted by the Starham? / Sorry, you first. / Excavation equipment. I want to tunnel out from under this dome. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1070
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1071
I haven't done any digs around these parts in a long while, but when I did the RDCLBA provided most of the heavy machinery. / Can I borrow your keys? They probably haven't changed the locks since you were an agent. / It still might be dangerous. Try not to flip out and kill anyone. / Am I really that tense? / Well, I wasn't going to say anything, but then I was, and then I did. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1071
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1072
Stealth, Triangle, stealth. A few minutes of patience won't hurt anything. / Did you hear a noise? / Probably. Does it matter? / The RDCLBA's really lost its edge under the new leadership. / This door looks garagey, let's see what they have for digging equipment. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1072
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1073
And so, having circumvented the Cartoonist's efforts, Triangle leads Robert, Cube, and the five Food Sentries out from beneath the dome of MSG. / What new adventures await them in the changed world beyond? Good question. For the answer, let's turn to noted adventurologist Prozac the Bear. / Hi! I'm Prozac the Bear! / Come to think of it, let's not. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1073
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1074
Nothing seems different so far. / The nearest town is seventeen to the south. We should head there. / Seventeen what? / Seventeen spaces, I guess. / Spaces? / Seventeen turns later... / Turns? / No thanks, my stomach's fine. / No, I didn't say "Tums?", I said "Turns?". / You sure? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1074
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1075
The town is intact. There are no signs of struggle. Sheep patrol its streets. / That's not technically a haiku. / Everyone seems to be going about their normal business, just with sheep as law enforcement. / It is Sheep Law! / Excuse me, sir, can you tell me what's been happening? / Baa. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1075
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1076
Excuse me, could you... / Baa! / They're not talking ot us. / They're saying "baa". / Because they don't want to talk. / They're speaking to each other properly, it's not a matter of ability. / I guess that means we eavesdrop. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1076
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1077
[insert appropriate lyrics from any of several They Might Be Giants songs] / You'll have to be more specific. / Well, everyone's going about more or less their normal business, but slowly and quietly, as if they're in a trance. / Also, I suddenly have a craving for a piece of string and a rock to wind the string around. / Just shut up. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1077
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1078
Wait here. / What? / Excuse me, do you sell string? / Aisle 3. / You know, you're the first person I've talked to today who hasn't baaed at me. / Wait, you're... are you Robert? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1078
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1079
I read your strip right up to the end, you know. / What end? This is the strip now. / I suppose the sheep must be blocking it then. / What's going on with the sheep? How did they take over? / Where have you been? / In the MSG dome. / Oh yeah, the strip ended with that dome thing.... / It didn't end! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1079
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1080
I'm sorry. I can't tell you anything about what's going on. / Why not? / Buy your string and leave. / Um... has the currency changed under sheep rule, or can I use my old money? / Still being phased out. You should change it in the next couple days. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1080
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1081
String! / That's great. / I know! / It doesn't explain how the sheep took over or what the Oval's secret weapon is, though. / How do you know? Have you asked it? / Can I make a joke involving the computer science usage of the term "string", or is my quota for forced geek humor full? / Sorry, I'm not in this strip. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1081
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1082
We'll get no answers from the townsfolk. We need to find the ovine chain of command. / Ducks? / Thanks. / Oh, no. Why now? / I think the previous strip was so self-referentially bad as to warp time itself. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1082

Mr. Disease! Triangle's caught in another space-time-ducks-thanks loop! / Linda!

I beat every last sheep in town, no thanks to these slackers! / How many were there? / I wasn't keeping track! The Dairy Sentry tried counting them and fell asleep like you did. / Slackers? / Sheep are made of meat. You're the Meat Sentry. We're not. We were trying just as hard as you were. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1093
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1094
We'll have to settle this, but this isn't the time. We're a team and we have a common goal. Let's work towards it. / I'll agree with you for the moment. Now someone get me some ginger! / I've found some. / This recipe the Meat Sentry's working on... are you sure it'll bring Triangle back into normal time? / Probably. If not, at least we'll have something for dinner. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1094
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1095
The sheep! They're dead! You killed all the sheep! Why? How? / Well... / No sense letting all this mutton just rot. Help me get a barbecue pit going. / Could you explain some things to me? / I wish I could. It's... just not possible. I can't tell you any more. Honestly, if there were any way I could... it's just... not... geometrically... possible. / Was... that... a... hint??? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1095
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1096
It's ready! / Watch out for the barbecue pit! / Ah! Good to see the mutton being used! / Good? More like disturbing. A couple hours ago these sheep were the town's police force. No one was even trying to resist them.... Now that they're dead they're just barbecue fodder. There's something happening in this town that we're not getting. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1096

Ducks? / Thanks. / Here! Eat this! / Thanks. / Duck! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1097
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1098
Parsley storm! / Baa? / I can't help but think there was a way to stop that sheep without burying everything thirty-two pixels deep in parsley. / It was the first defense I could think of. / Well, add some rosemary and mint, it'll be good for the disturbing barbecue of our foes' remains. / Sure thing. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1098
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1099
None of us can tell you anything. Really. / Yet you can tell us that you can't tell us anything.... / No, we can't... well, yes, we can, but only in lieu of telling you something else. / But why? What's stopping you? / None of us can tell you that! That's the whole point of what I've been saying! / This is going nowhere. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1099
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1100
You overdid the garnishes. / I know. / There's not nearly enough meat to use all this. / I know. / What are you going to do? / Tread herbs and hope for a strong wind. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1100
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1101
The parsley level's going down now. We'll be fine unless it backs up the sewers. / You shouldn't have mentioned that possibility. / Have you considered that I might have a reason? / No. / Good. We'll be fine. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1101
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1102
Hi! I'm Prozac the Bear and I smell barbecue! / Well, that answers one question I had. / Is it ready yet? Is it ready yet? Is it ready yet? / What question was that? / It was nothing. I was being paranoid. / And? / Forget about it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1102
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1103
Mutton? / No thanks, I'm pondering. / The sheep were in charge when we came to this town. No one would tell us anything about what happened. We butchered the sheep. People are eating them. They're still not telling us anything. / Meanwhile, the Cartoonist has been uncharacteristically silent, even when given straight lines and openings for easily-drawn humor. What do you think? / I think this is the last time we make you the designated ponderer. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1103
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1104
I think the situation calls for telepathy. / And? / And that's as far as I've gotten. We don't know any telepaths that would help us, do we? / No. / Scratch that idea. / You're the... Dairy Sentry, right? I keep getting you guys mixed up. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1104
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1105
Yes. I'm the Dairy Sentry. The isoceles triangle is the Vegetable Sentry. / Miss Concarne is the Meat Sentry, the Food Pyramid is the Grain Sentry, and Mr. Disease... still hasn't told us what he calls his food group. / He hasn't? / He says if he tells us now we'll just laugh and we won't get it until the proper moment. / He likes drama. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1105
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1106
I doubt we'll learn anything in this town. We need to move on. / Whither? / We need to find the Cornersheep and/or the Oval. You know where the Cornersheep's base was in Scotland. Maybe they rebuilt it. / Scotland's a long way away. / For us, yes. Not for Prozac the Bear. / I've heard enough. Plan rejected. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1106
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1107
Baa? / Heh, neat disguise. / Think I can infiltrate the sheep? / Not really, but they might take you somewhere important when they capture you. Go for it. / Triangle approved the plan. Let's get going. / He was being sarcastic! / No, I wasn't. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1107
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1108
The Cornersheep must know that this town's sheep are dead. He'll have sent reinforcements. / From where? / I don't know. Our best chance at infiltrating their ranks will be after they've entered the town and before they encounter Triangle and company. / We might, MIGHT pass as sheep visually, but what about the Cornersheep's telepathy? / I wish you hadn't pointed that out. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1108
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1109
We let you slip into the reinforcements, then we rout them, then you leave with them. / That's the plan. / And how long do we wait for these reinforcements to show up? Maybe the Cornersheep's given up on this town. / You could be right. Maybe someone should do recon. / Hi! I'm Prozac the reco / No. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1109
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1110
The Grain Sentry's the one with some vague notion of stealth, right? / All of us have a vague notion of stealth. / Well, who has the most odorless cooking? / Yes, that would be the Grain Sentry. / Get him. He'll lead the scouting group. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1110
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?991
Hi! I'm Prozac the Bear! You might be wondering what's been going on. If you are, stop it. It won't help. / Now let's all eat pie. / fin http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?991
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?992
Are we okay now? / Yeah. / So I can move five pixels without getting trapped in a plot hole? / Yes, yes. It'll only happen when I'm focusing on Prozac the Bear. / You're going to have to figure out what he was doing at the talk show sooner or later. / Am not! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?992
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?993
Hello. / Triangle. I was expecting you. / How? / I follow the strip. / Oh. So you know what I'm wondering about. / Mostly, but he didn't draw the actual diagram. / Here's a copy. / It's still not drawn. / No, but you can read it between strips. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?993
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?994
The Fourth Race must have had tools we don't. There's nothing special anywhere in the designated area. / Tools... oh well. / If you come across more information, let me know. I would like to get to the bottom of this. / I'm sure something will turn up. / While I'm still in the strip, can I say hi to my mom? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?994
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?995
The race is underway. There can only be, at most, one Eighth... Race... Wait. Go back and change that first word "race" to "contest". / Would you really want me to tamper in time like that? / Dialogue is not time. Nonetheless I see your meaning. / The race is indeed underway. I count four competitors. Does that match your count? / The MSG entity, the Cornersheep's version of the Fifth Race, the Ovalnaut's version of the Fourth Race, and myself. Correct. / I wasn't counting you. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?995
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?996
There is a small chance that Prozac the Bear will be the founder of the Eighth Race. / That's sick. / I know. It's a long shot, though. I'm not going to worry about it. / Worry about me. / There will be an Eighth Race, Orpuddex. You can't change that. / You wouldn't be so flippant if you could draw what I'm actually supposed to look like. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?996
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?997
Triangle and Robert Wacky Scheme Consultants, how may we inadvertently maim you? / Triangle, this is Cube. I have an idea. / Hold on. Robert, put that cricket down! It's already the right size for a cricket! / Sorry, Robert's come up with a sort of growth ray thing and I can't pull him away from it. / Does it work? / Strictly speaking, no. It can scale things up about eight hundred percent, but it introduces aliasing artifacts and everything's pixelly. / Sounds like the Cartoonist is about to start playing with a new tool. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?997
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?998
What's this idea? / I want to go back to Tetris. I suspect that among the working Fourth Race technology there I can find astronomical equipment. / You barely escaped last time. / Right, and I should be able to do it again. / Okay, you can use the sub, but I'm coming with you. / That's perfectly fine by me. / I'll see if the Sentries can come. I don't think Tetris will be so easy to get into this time. / What about Robert? / No, I don't think so. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?998
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?999
I wouldn't want to come along anyway. I'm busy with my experiments. / The Meat Sentry and I will come. There are... tensions. It would not do well for all five Sentries to share a submarine. / How did I get from home to Mr. Disease in less than one panel? / I needed to move things along. The thousandth strip is tomorrow. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?999
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1000
... this is the best you could do for strip 1,000? / Sadly, yes. / Don't strain yourself. / ... / I hope I'm not the punchline. / {{signed: pshaughn}} http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1000
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1001
Never do that again. / I'm not promising anything. / It didn't even advance the plot. / Everything is the plot. / Except when it's non-canonical or you pretend it didn't happen. / Those too are plot, of a sort. / Was Cube the punchline? / No. I was. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1001
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1002
Is the submarine ready? / More or less. / Is this trip really necessary? I mean, aren't there other sites with Fourth Race technology that are less... underwater? / None in working order. The automata of Tetris have maintained the city. / On the way there you'll have to tell me what you know about Tetris. / That won't take long. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1002

Why... / Hi! I'm Prozac the Submarine! / That's it, the expedition's off. / Why is he a submarine? / I don't know, I don't care, I'm not going. / We can find another vehicle. / All aboard? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1003
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1004
Hey Triangle, I... / What? / Why is he a submarine? / I'm trying very hard not to care. Now what is it? / I just found a... no, this is bugging me. I'm going to ask why he's a submarine. / Splash splash! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1004
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1005
The pharmaceutical one has become the submarine of the wacky rhombus and the Chosen One. I find myself baffled. / It's definitely a puzzle! / Everyone, I talked it over with Mr. the Bear and I think I understand the situation. I'll have to tell you between strips, though, the Cartoonist hasn't figured it out yet. / Well, I've figured out PART of it, he's being drawn toward Tetris because of his potential destiny to found the Eighth Race. It's just the whole rest of the situation I haven't figured out. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1005
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1006
Any questions? / Why haven't the other potential Eighth Race founders turned into submarines? / They don't need to go to Tetris. They already have enough power. Also, I don't think they could change shape anyway. Prozac is a very special case. / How do we get to Tetris now that Prozac gutted the real sub? / You could use a giant water beetle. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1006
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1007
Pardon me... do you HAVE any giant water beetles? / But of course. / On the voyage to Tetris... / How exactly are we breathing? / Are we breathing? / I'm taking care of that. / [[DEHYDRATED OXYGEN]] http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1007
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1008
Prozac sighted to aft starboard and closing! / Does a beetle have a starboard? / I'm an ice cream man, not an etymologist. / No, you're an archaeologist. And you mean "entomologist", not "etymologist". / No, I mean "etymologist". It's a question of the origin of the word "starboard". http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1008
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1009
Prozac is overtaking us. Is that a problem? / I don't... think so.... I doubt he's going to interfere with us. / Can this beetle go any faster? / I don't know. Robert didn't go into detail. / This thing doesn't have a kitchen! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1009

[[Triangle, Robert, Cube, Linda, and Mr. Disease are traveling to the ancient city of Tetris aboard a giant water beetle.]] / "Stop teasing the Meat Sentry" sounds ... um ... / Vaguely obscene? / Yes. / Different worlds, different standards. Anyway, Cube was about to tell me about Tetris. / There's not all that much to tell. / It was an experimental city of the Fourth Race maintained by their polygonal automata. After it sank, the automata continued to guard it for their drowned masters. I believe that the Seventh Race began when some of these polygons developed independent intelligence. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1011
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1012
I smell inconsistency. / Yes, I'm defrosting some. / No.... Cube, was Tetris inhabited by humans or polygons? / The city was ruled by humans. Its day-to-day running was handled by primitive constructs which, from a purely geometric perspective, can only be termed "polygons". / Exactly how much intelligence and autonomy did these polygons have? What you are saying now contradicts what you said about that videotape. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1012
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1013
The videotape contained no humans. Perhaps it was made after the city sank, or after the death of the Fourth Race. / So the automata made it themselves? / They might have had standing orders to make time capsules or almanacs. / See? No plot hole. I know what I'm doing. Ha ha! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1013

Prozac the...

Stop him! He's going to destroy the city! / Doctor... Mario? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1014

If he moves adjacent to that block sticking out near the top, he'll start a chain reaction that'll destroy most of the wall and flood the city! / Line of four there, those fall that way, hit there... she's right. You'd better stop him. / How? I don't even know what Dr. Mario is. / I can talk you through it, but there is little time.

Okay, so what are... / Mathematical constructivists believe that if something can't be proven to exist it doesn't exist, right? / That's not totally accurate, but okay... / Totalitarian constructivists believe that if something can't be proven to exist, then it shouldn't exist. / They have a very elegant proof that smoking piles of rubble exist and are fond of invoking it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1023
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1024
The philosopher automata of Tetris were constructed more to get grant money than to solve any actual problem. They resolved several interesting philosophical dilemmas, but had to be deactivated because of their brutal / methodology after they started to reify consciousness. They were kept intact for the same reason as most of Tetris: just in case. / I present a more compelling philosophical issue than you, so as long as you stay out of the strip they shouldn't try to prove you. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1024

[[The Cartoonist is under attack from the philosopher automata of Tetris.]] / Well. You're the philosophy team. I think I should first point out that you can't hurt me. The only reason I'm not just letting you attack is to protect the others. / You can't prove that I exist. You have no access to the world in which I have form. Thus, you will attack unless I can show that an attack is unnecessary. / To this end, I intend to prove to you that I do not exist, and thus do not need to be destroyed. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1025
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1026
[[The Cartoonist is under attack by the philosopher automata of Tetris.]] / ...therefore, either I cease to exist between strips, which implies a contradiction as previously demonstrated, or time is discrete and I am therefore unchanging, which I have shown untrue. / Elegant, but flawed. If you exist and your existence is unprovable, the syllogism of branch 2 breaks and no contradiction exists. Therefore, you have only shown that your existence cannot be proven. / But you're constructivists. Unprovable existence is no existence. / Constructivism is a meta-logical interpretation, not an axiom. It cannot be invoked as part of a proof. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1026
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1027
[[The Cartoonist is under attack by the philosopher automata of Tetris.]] / So I can't prove I exist, I can't prove I don't exist, you can't stop me from existing, I can't prove you can't stop me from existing, and Prozac the Bear just had an interesting thought a few corridors away. / If you'd proven constructivism, you could use it in a proof. Since you're not allowing it in proofs, you haven't proven it, and so you must destroy your own constructivist programming! I'm Prozac the Bear! / As much as I hate the self-destruct cliche, he's got a point. / Constructivism can exist as a belief without necessarily being true.... Can't it?

These documents are well-preserved. / They're too technical for me to translate. / Let's each take as many papers as we can carry back to the beetle. / Any preference? / Diagrams. Photographs if there are any. Anything that might be a memo or summary. Charts. / How about comics? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1034
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1035
Comics? / Cheaply-printed full-color comic books, to be exact. / Ah! These were for distribution to elementary schools. These might be just the level we need. / Our science can't be that far behind the Fourth Race. / Behind, no, but different. The scientific paradigms of man differed greatly from our own. We need to relearn their concepts from the ground up before we can translate them to our own. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1035
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1036
You might want to cancel the ant-escape idea. Triangle et cetera are on their way back. / I've already abandoned it. / That sounds ominous. / If giant insects start overrunning the city someone's bound to mention the square-cube law, and I don't want to have to hear the subsequent puns. / So what are you doing with the insects you already have? / Protein drinks. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1036

From the sunken city of blocks and right angles the beetle swam landward, shortly followed by Prozac the Bear, who had again taken the semblance of a submersible vessel. / Yours truly, who has been reading a rather excessive quantity of the writing of Fritz Leiber, found himself irresistably compelled to describe this scene most verbosely and thus, not entirely incidentally, occupy an entire strip with naught but words. / To learn more about Fritz Leiber, visit your local library. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1040
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1041
You're back! What did you bring me? What did you bring me? / Oh... here, have a comic book. / Hey! This is educational! / You can understand it? / Of course I can understand... / Oh yeah. I wasn't looking at the words. I have no idea what it says, it just looks educational. / You do understand comics, don't you.... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1041
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1042
If you get the chance try to... "read"... as much of that comic book as you can. We know our own comic metaphors are similar to those of humans. / So while Cube translates the text I can come up with an interpretation for the pictures? / Exactly. You're being very lucid. / He's coming down from a wackiness binge. / (Please don't tell Triangle about the you-know-what-phids.) http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1042
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1043
How can it keep switching back and forth between four and five dimensions? This theory makes no sense! / Back to the comic book again, see if I can decipher the lettering... why did it have to be hand-lettered? They could have at least had a typewritten "fun facts" page at the back.... / Find anything yet? / Tons of confirmation, but nothing new. The Fourth Race had three different systems of physics, only somewhat interchangeable. / So, like diet plans? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1043
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1044
I don't know, look this over. It needs another pair of... no, I mean two heads are better... no, I don't know. I've been spending too much time with human idioms. / Hm... ah. Time as well as space is composed of pudding and thus has the potential to be lumpy. / What? Hey, that could be what it's saying, and if so that actually sense. I didn't know you were good with physics. / I'm not. I just recognised the equations for pudding. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1044
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1045
A lump of that scale can't be stable. It'd have collapsed into a star long ago. / You're not an astronomer. / True. There's been one in the strip already, I'll bring the problem to her. / I'll escort you. / The protestors seem likely to get violent. / Ah, so that's what you're doing here. / Yes, guarding. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1045
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1046
The tone is optimistic. The creators of this book either believed that the Fourth Race could overcome the doom / of the previous three, or they wished to forestall panic. After a brief description of... whatever the thing is in space that it's describing... it goes into moderate / detail about the Oval mission. / If I'd known you had that much to say I'd have stood off-panel so you could fit it in better. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1046
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1047
I'm in the strip again! I can tell because I suddenly can't think of what my name is. / I'm sorry, I'm horrible with names. / The Cartoonist! / Cube's coming with some documents... eh, I don't need to tell you, you read this thing daily. / It's an honor, sir. / Don't... don't address me like that unless it's sarcasm. / Is your low self-esteem that critical to the strip? / No, I just have trouble writing anything good about myself, and when I have trouble writing I end up bringing in Prozac the Bear. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1047
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1048
...and as you see here, the... diagram vanished. / Sorry, I'll come back. / ...and as you see here, the Oval was never intended to return. I think. / That seems a reasonable interpretation. / I'm still not done with the whiteboard. / You can move it off-panel to see it. I think I should be here. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1048
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1049
So a spatial lump collapses into a star as it moves through time, and a temporal lump collapses as it moves through space. / Yes, that's how the symmetries work out. / Then how can a lump be stable? / One lump can't, but a temporal lump can stop an object from moving through time just as a spatial lump can block spatial motion. / So? / Pudding is sticky. Lumps adhere. / Right. So? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1049
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1050
Okay, I admit I'm going out on a limb, but it looks to me like the anomaly the Oval was sent to investigate is a dual space-time pudding lump. / And that would mean? / About such a binary lump, time would fail to advance and would instead sort of circle around. / So when the Earth nears the lump history starts over? / In a sense, exactly. / Can you combine "in a sense" with "exactly"? It sounds wrong. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1050

The Oval? / You seek to overthrow the Seveth Race. We should ally. / Tell me more. / {{many symbols in space separated groups of: 2,4,2,5,4,8}} / Cut that out. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?931
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?932
THAT WAS JUST TO VERIFY YOUR INTELLIGENCE LEVEL. / It's super. Read my flank. / NOW I KNOW. / May I see you? / I WOULD PREFER NOT TO EMERGE.

Tell me about these new recipes. / The cube finally convinced me that the four food groups were fallacious.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?938
All our food is derived from the Fourth Race. / Really? / Yes.

Taste this. / How can I hope to convey the sensation of taste as experienced by a polygon, of a flavor with no correspondence to the human tongue? / All that I can say to perhaps describe at least the magnitude of the experience, if not its nature, is that the next words Triangle speaks follow logically from what has transpired, despite the seeming incongruities. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?939

Robert, could you go next door and borrow a cup of existential dread? I'm running low. / I mean... no, I don't know what I mean. / I think I know what's wrong. / Cartoonist? Budget your time better. Don't write strips tired. / "Ytied" is "Deity" spelled backwards. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?955
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?956
I'm better now. / [[Triangle and Robert have nothing to say]] / I still have no strip ideas, but I'm not writing tired. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?956
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?957
The plot stopped. Let's get out and push. / I hear you. / Gee. I wonder what Mr. Disease is doing today. / Me too. I bet he's talking to the other Sentries about his new abilities. / That must be an interesting conversation. / Yes. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?957
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?958
So how would you contend with Abyss Carrot Surprise? / Counter with Rock Candy Shield, sugar-free variant, then retaliate with Inedible Chunks Number Nine. / You're just making attack names up! / I had not expected you to believe me without a demonstration. / Do you see that mountain over there? / No. / That is correct. I should have thought out this demonstration more clearly. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?958
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?959
I believe him. / Has you ever eaten at his restaurant? / No. / No. / Do so. That will be all the demonstration you need. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?959
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?960
I still have my memories of the time I spent as an inverted capital G. Even in my weakened form, I was able to work / small magics using the power of your table scraps. You are a powerful chef, and with a new food group under your command, I cannot doubt / that you are a Sentry. / Your confidence is hearting, but your verbosity leaves little space for a punchline. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?960
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?961
Therefore, there exist infinitely many numbers lonelier than the number one. / What about over the integers? / There exist negative integers at least as lonely as the number one. The proposition only holds if the domain is restricted to the integers greater than zero. / "One is the loneliest postive integer..." / Doesn't scan as well, no. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?961
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?962
It is decided. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we shall consider Mr. Disease a fifth Sentry. / Each of our food groups has its lore, eons old. This new group has none. What is the role of its Sentry? What are his duties? / Those will have to be discovered... or invented. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?962
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?963
There may be a relevant piece of lore.... Mightn't this new food group be the one that includes Apocalypse-in-a-Can? / You refer to the prophesies of Gary the Stupid? / It was just a thought! / I have heard of Gary the Stupid, but never as a prophet. Tell me of this Apocalypse-in-a-Can. / Wait, you've heard of Gary the Stupid? Really? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?963
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?964
Gary the Stupid, author of "99 Things You Shouldn't Do With a Toaster Oven and Two That Are Illegal". I've heard of him. The worst chef ever. / Not the worst. That is a common misconception. A worse chef was Amrel the Very Mad. / Do you mean Emdrol the Mad? / No, Amrel the Very Mad, founder of the catering chain that would go on to become United Industrial Building Supply. / I've never heard of that one. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?964
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?965
Gary the Stupid's incompetence as a chef, while substantial, was hardly unmatched. He is remembered where other chefs are / forgotten because of the quantity of his writing. / I knew he wrote many alleged cookbooks. There were other works? / Many, on topics as diverse as genetic algorithms and the history of opera. / Those were in the same book, mind you. / It sounds like Cube would have liked him. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?965
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?966
Enough sidetracking. The book in question is entitled "Things That Will Eventually Happen" and it is a book of prophecies. / It is remarkable in that its prophecies are just as vague as those in any other collection, and yet in the centuries since Gary the Stupid wrote them not a single one has come even remotely true. / Some say that this demonstrates a total lack of psychic sensitivity on the part of Gary. Others believe just the opposite. It is in this book that Apocalypse-in-a-Can is described in some length. / Did anyone ever tell you you look like Triangle when you're partially off-panel? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?966
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?967
This discussion is senseless! If the Apocalypse-in-a-Can's mention in the Stupid Prophecies signifies anything at all, it is that it does not and will never exist! / I'm sensing some tension here. You Sentries don't do much work as a team, do you? / Indeed. / You are correct. We should all calm down and try not to bicker. / Already Mr. Disease shows his wisdom. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?967
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?968
There is now a fifth Sentry. We must strike immediately! / Baa? / Alone if we must. All signs indicate that the Sentries will be a very dangerous source of opposition if we wait for our friend's plan to go into effect. / Baa. Baa! / Our mysterious ally shared with me certain pieces of technology. Europe will be ours within a month. / Baa, baa. Baa baa, baa... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?968
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?969
Using the strange technology from the Oval, the Cornersheep constructed and fortified small camps of sheep throughout the land of Europe. / Think real-time strategy games for a good example. New factories constructing both sheep and robots assembled themselves from raw materials in seconds. Among the many by-products of the construction methods was a substantial amount of monosodium glutamate. / It wasn't happy. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?969
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?970
I just read the last strip. / Me too. It's not very plausible. / Do you think it happened? / It must have. Things that don't happen don't go in the strip. / Sometimes they do. / It happened. I might have exaggerated the scope and speed of the operation, but it happened. / So the Cornersheep's about to conquer Europe. / ...no. I think I see what happens next. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?970
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?971
You figured it out, Robert? How about you explain it for the readers. / You're getting me to write the strip for you, aren't you. / Mmmmaybe. It's that or Europe is overrun by militant sheep, though. / Right. Well, obviously the MSG entity is approaching critical mass and will soon be able to consciously manifest itself. / That was implied, yes. / Whoever or whatever's in the Oval wouldn't have trusted the Cornersheep with so much power so readily unless there were some kill switch or Achilles' heel. / Ooh, you're right! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?971
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?972
So, the neural-flavored network substitute will shut down the Cornersheep's new bases given the appropriate motivation. / What motivation can we give it? / No need. / It's already decided to halt the construction. I'm not entirely sure why. I think it's experiencing jealousy. / Uh... right, sure. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?972
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?973
As quickly as it began, the Cornersheep's hasty attempt at conquest comes to an end. A jamming signal from beneath the Earth's crust deactivates every one of the new bases. A second signal from another direction entirely causes them to disassemble themselves. / You sabotaged me. / What? / You gave the destruct order. / What destruct... Oh. Oh my. This is bad. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?973

Telepaths. How many? / What? / On this world. / Psychic powers in general aren't uncommon, but I'm fairly certain I'm the only functioning telepath. / You're wrong. / The override codes were stored only in my memory.

[[stupid gradient]] / Did the rest of you feel that? / The stupid gradient? / No, I think the Cartoonist just put that there to indicate something was happening. I mean the quick psychic flash of metallic flavor and panicked mutton. / Panicked mutton? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?975

Okay, just answer Y or N. Are you who I think you are? / Y. / Are you in danger? / N. / Are you trying to warn me about something? / Y. / Is it the Cornersheep/Oval alliance? / N. / Is it Orpuddex? / S. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?977
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?978
Does the danger involve Orpuddex in some way? / Y. / Does it relate to the Time of the Oval? / Y. / Does it relate to the Oval itself? / N. / Is this method of conversation transparent padding on the part of the Cartoonist? / |Y| / I'll take that as a yes. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?978

Backstage at yet another talk show... / The Helix Twins interview is running long. Can I get you anything? / Is there anything to read? / I'll get some magazines. / They're all astronomy, sorry. / That'll do. / This cover looks familiar. I've seen it before, but not as a map of... of course! It's not WHAT the Oval is, it's WHERE it is! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?979
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?980
You can't go out there yet! The Helix Twins are still on! / This is important. / It's a buoy! It's a buoy! / Congratulations! I didn't even know you were married. / No, not a... I mean the Oval. It's a buoy, a marker in space! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?980
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?981
You're interrupting the Helix Twins. This had better be real good. / It is. I'll need to make a phone call. / You should have done that first!... / Briefly later... / The Helix Twins are done, you're up. / Thanks. Let me know when a fax comes. / So, Cube... what's this big discovery you frightened the Helix Twins about? / Believe me, it's good. Let me start by introducing my research in general. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?981
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?982
Triangle? What was that all about? / Cube needed me to fax a rubbing to the studio. / A rubbing of what? / I don't know, some templey thing. / What did it look like? / A crowded arrangement of arbitrary looking symbols. An electron micrograph of pudding. How should I know? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?982
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?983
My stage manager's telling me you just got a... / Fax? Great, have him bring it up here. / Now, look at this magazine cover. Can you get a shot of it? It is, of course, a map of the galaxy. The dotted line is the path our solar system follows every something-or-other thousands of years. / Now, this... thank you. This fax is a rubbing of a diagram found in many so-called "temples" of the Fourth Race, usually on the same stone as some reference to the Time of the Oval. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?983
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?984
Look at them side by side. The notation is unfamiliar, but the temple diagram is a galactic map, accurate as of a few centuries before the fall of the Fourth Race. / This taco curve is our planet. The arrows are its path through the galaxy. These big concentric ovals are... the important bit. The Fourth Race knew something about that part of the galaxy we don't. They sent the Oval ahead to probe it, but the Oval did not return. When the Earth came to pass through that region, it was the end of Man. / Compare with the magazine map, and you will see that the Earth has passed through that region two times since then. These correspond to the declines of the Fifth and Sixth Races. / And... we're in that region now. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?984
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?985
Yes. I don't know much astronomy, but whatever's there causes waves of mutations, and probably other effects as well. / The Cornersheep's telepathy, the nascence of the MSG entity, possibly even the return of Orpuddex and the coming of the Cartoonist are due to this... I hate the word "anomaly", but it's the only one I can think of. / I guess this was worth interrupting the Helix Twins for... maybe. / Yes. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?985
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?986
Is all that true? / I believe so. That cube is more intelligent than he appears. / I still think you sabotaged my bases, you know. / I understand that. I would think the same in your position. / Except for the genocidal hatred of polygons, you're a very reasonable man. / Did you mean to think that first part out loud? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?986
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?987
We need to get to the bottom of this. Do we know any astronomers? / No. Wait... sort of. / Orpuddex? / Well, him, but also there was a client a couple of months ago... no, never mind, she swore to kill us next time we met. / She swore to kill you. I think she might be willing to talk to me. / Oh, rub it in. She did have giant mantis insurance. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?987
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?988
I'm going to see the astronomer and then when I get back we're going to have a long talk about this giant insect habit of yours. / I can quit any time I want to! / Then stop now. You know I can't draw the things. / No! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?988

Let us now contemplate Prozac the Bear. What was it that transpired on the set of Diurnal Anomaly with Brian N. O'Cone? The broadcast that night gave no hint of the strange intrusion of the Prozac called Bear. / First, we must ask ourselves how Prozac came to be at the studio, and indeed how he (if such a pharmaceutical can be called "he") survived the wrath of the awakened ferret-god. The answers here are simple: Prozac is not of this world. He is a manifestation of the Cartoonist's... uh... / He is a manifestation of the Cartoonist's. Does that work without a noun? It had better. I don't have the energy to fix it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?989

One line from an episode of Mr. Ed has been stuck in my brain for most of my life. The line is "What am I, a horse or a ballerina?". I'm not sure of the context. I might have never even seen the episode. The line was in an ad on Nick at Night. / Understand what that has to do with anything and you might understand Prozac the Bear. / And then, ask yourself: what am I?

This is stupid. The past two strips have been about us not knowing whether we're home or not because there aren't any backgrounds. / And me farting. / Howdy, neighbors!

Your cakes... / They smell like poo. / Poo? Why, darn it, you're right. / Here I've been racking my brain for months trying to figure out what it was the smell of my little cakes reminded me of, and sure enough that's what I was trying to think of. Poo! They do smell exactly like poo. Wonder I didn't recognize it sooner. / They're supposed to smell like that? / I'm too hungry to argue. Let's dig in. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?62

I know I can't communicate with sheep... but I definitely let them go, and I think they asked me to do it. / I have been under a lot of mental pressure lately... maybe I imagined I understood them because I subconciously wanted them to escape. / Sounds plausible... / Or maybe certain sheep exhibit telepathy in cases of extreme duress. / Not nearly as plausible, but it keeps my sanity intact.

Oh yeah, you're ALL gonna taste it soon! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?95
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?96
That was a bust. Now what? / This place looks like it's hiring. / [[A shopfront: / THE LOCUST GARDEN / AUTH NTIC CHINES QUISINE / In the windows are signs: / WAITSTAFF WANTED / DISHWASHERS WANTED / COOKS WANTED / MANAGER WANTED / EXTERMINATOR WANTED / PARAMEDIC WANTED]] / Okay, but I'm only going along with this because it'll be funny. / No openings for rodeo clowns... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?96
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?97
Welcome to the Locust Garden. May I take your orders? / I'm not sure. What's good today? / I'd recommend the green rice. / Green? / It was white to start with, but... well, you know. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?97
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?98
Your fortune cookies, sir, ma'am. / Mine says, "I hope for your sake you didn't have the chicken." / Mine is, "Joy comes to you when you contemplate the simpler things. The big picture will take care of itself... in bed." / In bed? / That's what it says. It also says my lucky number is Kevin Murphy. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?98
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?99
Welcome to the Locust Garden, may I take your order? / You! Chosen One! Now we shall do battle! / Listen, Orpuddex, I'm not going to kill you over some lumpy pudding from billions of years ago. / In that case, I'll have the lo mein. / Will that be the pork lo mein with dead roach, the beef lo mein with rat hair, or the vegetable lo mein with gooey black substance? / Which is cheapest? / The chicken, but you don't want it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?99

Happy 100th strip from all of us at Triangle and Robert and The Locust Garden! / And while the fools are occupied with the 100th strip festivities, I shall set my plan into action. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?100
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?101
Waiter, I want to complain about this fortune cookie. / What's the problem? / It says my lucky number is Patrick McGoohan. / And your problem is? / He is not a number, he is a free man! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?101
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?102
Who is Number One? / You are Triangle. / Who is Number One? / You are Triangle. / Okay, let's try this from a different angle... Who is Triangle? / You are Number one-- DARN IT! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?102
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?103
Sign here for delivery. / Shouldn't this comma be a decimal point? / No, it's ten thousand pounds. That's what we always deliver here. / Well, okay. / OKAY, BRING IN THE TRUCK! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?103
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?104
Baa! / WHAT? / Well, well. It appears that I'm not the only one attempting to control the world's supply of artificial flavorings. Somewhere, someone is hoarding a massive stockpile of MSG... but where? / Wow! This roast duck is really good! What's in it? / That's The Locust Garden's exclusive blend of fourteen herbs and chemicals. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?104
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?105
Has it occured to you that this restaurant isn't exactly healthy? / It's fast Chinese. What do you expect? / There are little packets of MSG instead of salt. / Now that you mention it, it is a little upsetting that the complimentary bread glows in the dark. / And then there's the chicken... / Doesn't the chicken remind you of that scene in Indiana Jones when the Nazis open the Ark? / Yeah, it does, come to think of it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?105
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?106
I can play eight kinds of wind instruments with my nose. / You don't have a nose. / That's okay, I don't have eight kinds of wind instruments either. / See? Not funny. Can we go back to the plot now? / I'm sorry. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?106
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?107
Once upon a time, in a Chinese restaurant in a land far away, there lived three little shapes and a big bad super-intelligent telepathic sheep. The first little shape-- / Stop! / I told you once already, no childrens'-story parodies. / I thought after you did that Prisoner joke... / That was a one-time deal, and besides, The Prisoner isn't a childrens' story. / It's not? No wonder I grew up so weird. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?107
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?108
Let me in or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your Chinese restaurant down! / I'm sorry, we're not going the Three Little Shapes after all. / I designed and built that 300-foot fan for nothing? So... how AM I going to get in? / Will this do? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?108
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?109
What's that? / It's the restaurant's security system. / What's the big light on the left for? / That one goes on if a flock of sheep land on the roof. / I'd ask what the odds of that are but I don't want it to happen. / Too late. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?109
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?110
Bring be all of your MSG. Now. / Okay, fourteen thousand three hundred fifty-seven number fives, and would you like a beverage with that? / You have a number for it? / Of course. Do you want it here or to go? / Um... to go, please. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?110
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?111
Your order's ready. It comes to seven thousand dollars even, including tip. / No, you misunderstand. I'm not BUYING this MSG, I'm TAKING it! / And how are you planning to escape with over fourteen thousand pounds of potentially-carcinogenic meat enhancer? / Give me a minute, I'll think of something. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?111
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?112
I've got a hostage! Put all your MSG into a truck or the rhombus gets it! / It? / Yes. It. / Which would be exactly...? / You know... "it". It's like... Quit trying to stall me! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?112
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?113
You know, you look familiar. / I'm serious. Stop trying to stall me. / Stall? Stall! That's it! That's where I remember you from! You're the sheep I used the jumper cables on! / That knowledge is useless to you now. / Oh yeah? Triangle! Dump some sugar in its... um... grass tank! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?113
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?114
Wow. That was a close one. / Yeah, it... hey! I can't remember the actual fighting! / I couldn't draw the fight scene. Basically, there was a brawl between the restaurant patrons and the parasheep, who had some sort of ray guns that turned people into punctuation marks. You all fought very well, but the Cornersheep used his psychic powers to escape at the last second. He didn't get any of the MSG. / Now THAT is laziness. / What kind of supervillain name is The Cornersheep? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?114
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?115
So now we need to find a way to turn all these punctuation marks back into people. / Why? Oh... we're the main characters. / That and we'll probably get fired if we don't. / Who'd fire us? The cartoonist hasn't decided how to draw our boss yet. / Triangle? Where are our customers? / You were saying? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?115
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?116
If I were a super-intelligent telepathic sheep, where would I hide? / Isn't it obvious? / The abandoned Bahr company sweater factory on Wool Street! Of course! / I was thinking Lake Superior. / Why Lake Superior? / Never mind, it was a stupid thought. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?116
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?117
We can't just charge into the Cornersheep's lair blindly. We need a plan of attack. / Or a really big gun. / That's as good a plan as any. / Where can we get heavy weapons cheap? / I'll check the phone book. / We're not talking hunting rifles, you know. You're not going to find major arms dealers in the yellow pages. / Sure I am. They list them under "Escort Services". / That's prostitutes. / You sure? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?117
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?118
Silo Nineteen. I think I've heard of them. / The guy on the phone said they buy weapons cheap when governments collapse... and pass the savings on to us! / Even at a discount, we'll only be able to afford a couple rocket launchers. I don't think that'll be enough. / I'm way ahead of you. / You're not going to rob a convenience store, are you? / Way way ahead of you. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?118
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?119
You robbed a convenience store? / No! Do I look like the sort rhombus that would rob a convenience store? / Let me guess. The punchline is "It was a gas station," right? / No, but that's a lot funnier than what I was going to say. / Which was? / Gold card, baby! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?119
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?120
Assuming this second-hand arms dealership takes credit cards... / A reasonable assumption. / We'll still have the Cornersheep's psychic powers to contend with. / Only if he notices us. / He? / Well, I'm just guessing about the pronoun. He, it, whatever. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?120
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?31
Okay, I'll try to make this as simple as possible. / Please do. / The Beforings. Beings outside time and space. Universe-builders. They created, and indeed still create, universes. This one we inhabit is one of their most minor creations, a sort of doodle made by one between creating proper universes. / Is that why we're so badly drawn? / No, that's just because the cartoonist is a lazy jerk. / Hey! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?31
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?32
The Beforings. Beings outside time and space. They created this universe and many others, each with its own identity and purpose. / This universe is the universe of pudding. It began as pudding and shall end as pudding. I was created by the Beforings to be the Pudding-Watcher. / The Pudding-Watcher? / Yes. I was to watch over the pudding of the growing universe, the growing universe of pudding. / Do you have any idea how silly this all sounds? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?32
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?33
Yes, I know it sounds silly to mortal ears. Still, it is all too, too true. / Okay, sorry to interrupt. / I was meant to be the Pudding-Watcher, and so I was at first. Then came my shame, my horrible error. / You sure you want to talk about this? / Yes, yes. Mortal ears need to hear of it, so that my mistake will never be repeated. / This is going to turn into a cooking lesson, isn't it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?33
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?34
I was the Pudding-Watcher, and the pudding of the infant universe was my charge. / What... what happened? / I... I failed. The universe... it was a failure. The pudding became... it became... AAAAAARRRHH! / What? What did it become? What was so horrible? / No... no.... I know the tale must be told, but... my shame... I dare not speak it. / Wow. This is actually a pretty good story, sort of. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?34
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?35
Well, folks, I'm still all alone in the void between universes. / No, you're not. / I'm alone. The cartoonist doesn't count. / I mean you're not in the void. / I'm not? Then why can't I see anything? / I don't draw backgrounds. You should know that by now. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?35
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?36
Where am I? What happened? I remember... I remember trying to find the library... and there was this woman. She took me somewhere... somewhere strange. And now I'm here. / That's as good a recap as any. / So where is here? / On behalf of the Square Guild, we welcome you to Metric Land. / No. I'm not doing an Oz parody. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?36
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?37
Are you a good geometer or a bad geometer? / Well? Are you a good geometer or a bad geometer? / Why won't you answer us? / I categorically refuse to participate in any childrens'-story parodies. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?37
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?38
Ding dong, the geometer is dead, the wicked geometer is dead! / Look, I'm just NOT going to play along with this one. / I am Symmetra, the Good Geometer of 90 Degrees. / I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening. / La la la, la la la, la la la, I can't hear you. La la la, la la la, la la la, I can't hear you. La la la, la la la, la la la, I can't hear you. La la la, la la la, la la la, I can't hear you. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?38
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?39
Oh. Let me guess. The Dotted Line Road. Just... just give it up, okay? / Help me down from this pole! / Get bent. / Oil me.... / Find someone who cares. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?39
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?40
Uh... you awake? / I'm not moving until this feeble-minded Oz parody is over. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?40
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?41
OK, you win. I'm cancelling the Oz plotline. / Good. I can go home now? / Triangle, you've had the power to return home all along! / AAAAAAGH! / Sorry, what do you expect when you give me a straight line like that? / Human decency would be nice. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?41
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?42
So the Oz parody is really over? / You have my word. No more Oz jokes. / Why should I trust you? / Because I just got a great idea for an I Love Lucy parody. / Author? You got some 'splainin to do! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?42
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?43
The pudding grew lumpy. / Huh? / The universe, the universe of pudding which I was created to watch over.... I failed. I don't know what I did wrong, maybe I should have stirred it more.... / That's it? / What do you mean, "that's it?" An entire universe was my charge and I failed it! / But how would it being lumpy or not have mattered? It's not like anyone was planning on eating it... were they? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?43
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?44
Mortal, you simply do not comprehend the magnitude of my failure. / Sure I do. A bunch of pudding that nobody was going to eat anyway got lumpy. / Not merely a "bunch" of pudding, mortal! Not a "bunch"! A UNIVERSE of pudding! A universe that was meant to have a soft, creamy texture! Lumps in such a pudding aren't just a culinary annoyance! Lumps like that have their own gravitational pull! Now look what you made me do, there's no room for artwork in this panel. / Gravitational pull? Are you saying... / Yes. / Planets? / Yes. / Stars? / Yes. / ...US? / Indirectly, yes. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?44
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?45
The entire universe... my whole reality... all because of your one mistake? / Everything but the artwork. That was your cartoonist's mistake. / What do you mean, MY cartoonist! Who do you think's drawing you? / Is that the only reason you didn't run from me in terror? Because I'm badly drawn? / Well, yeah. You mean you didn't realise it? / Heck no! All this time I kinda figured you were the Chosen One. / Should I bother asking?... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?45
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?46
No Oz parodies, no I Love Lucy parodies, no Brady Bunch parodies, no Star Trek parodies, no Poewrpuff Girls parodies, no Saturday Night Live parodies. I am doing NO parodies. / Would you parody Get Smart? / I will not parody Get Smart. / Would you parody Newhart? / I will not parody Get Smart, I will not parody New-- Hey! No Dr. Seuss parodies! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?46
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?47
Why can't you just drop me into whatever plotline Robert's in? / He's getting some exposition right now that I don't want you to know. / What's the point? He'll just tell me when I see him. / Good point. I'll have to give him amnesia. / Just when you thought it was as contrived as it could get... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?47
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?48
Wow, I can't wait to tell Triangle all this! Imagine, him being the Chosen One and all... / Tell him nothing. / Oh? Oh... I understand. / Just to be sure, I'm going to have to eat your memories. / Will it hurt? / OH, yeah. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?48
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?49
Help! Someone help! The Pudding-Watcher is trying to eat my memories! / Whew! I should be safe in here. / DARN! I knew I should have taken the sign off that door. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?49
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?50
Happy 50th strip from all of us here at Triangle and Robert! / That gets me out of writing any jokes for today... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?50
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?51
Robert? How'd you get here? / Triangle? What are you doing in here? / I asked you first. / Well, the Pudding-Watcher was chasing me around in a haunted pudding factory trying to eat my memories... / Whatever. It can wait. / Yeah, it probably can. What now? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?51
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?52
Now, we... um... / Er... hmm. / Well. We're not asking the author for help, I know that much. / That's a given. / Any idea where we are? / It's called the "Zone of No Pudding," if that helps at all. / Doesn't ring a bell. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?52
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?53
By the way, I heard you had some exposition for me. / Exposition? Oh yeah... / You're the Chosen one called by the Beforings to punish Orpuddex for his crimes against pudding. / Will it make any more sense if I ask you to explain it? / Not really. / Then don't bother. Speaking of pudding, is there anything to eat? / Does lint count? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?53
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?54
So we're going to starve to death in a zone between universes? / Well, we at least have our memories. / If that's supposed to mean something, come out and say it. / Well, if Orpuddex wanted to eat my memories, maybe they have some sort of nutritional value. / It's worth a shot. Which memories should we try? / I know pi to 72 decimal places. I don't think I'll be needing it any time soon. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?54
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?55
So start reciting pi and we'll try to eat it. / 3.141... I just realized something. / Huh? Oh... eating pi. / Do we want a pun like that on our conscience? / I guess not. Do you have any other useless memories we can eat? / Do memories of lint count? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?55
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?56
I'd sooner starve to death than ask the author for help. / I'm with you. / We need to get back to our own universe, and soon. / Right. / And when we do, there's some sort of monster who'll try to eat your memories and/or kill me? / Not really a "monster", but basically. / We are so dead. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?56
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?57
I've got it! / What? / The cartoonist tried to put me in an Oz parody a little while ago. / Oz? Why didn't you say so? / Because it's so demeaning... / Give me the shoes and I'll do it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?57
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?58
There's no place like home... there's no place like home... / OUR home, you stupid shoes! OUR home! / I don't want to nitpick, but how did you click your heels with no feet? / You make a very good point. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?58
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?59
Let's try it together. / One... two... three... / There's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home. / Hooray! We're home... I think. / Maybe we should put up wallpaper or something. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?59
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?60
Is this home or are we still in the void? / I'm telling you, we seriously need to put up some wallpaper. / So you think we're home? / Can't you smell the radon? / Radon's odorless, and I don't think we have radon anyway. / Oh. In that case, I let one. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?60
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?181
Wacky is filling your car's tank with 3-octane gasoline. / Gotcha. / Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret. / What if you cut out the middleman and just fill the ferret with cheap gas? / Well, you could do that... probably... I guess. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?181
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?182
Wacky is a new lifeform evolving in your fridge. / Okay.... / Absurd is your fridge evolving into a new lifeform. / That reminds me... / We need to go to the grocery store and buy some more RNA. / You're not paying full attention. / Of course not. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?182
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?183
Wacky is when the men's room is out of order and you have to use the ladies' room. / Yup, that's wacky. / Absurd is when the men's room is out of order and you use a cabbage. / Hold that thought. / I have to go to the salad. / That's seriously wrong. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?183
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?184
Wacky is talking toast. / Yup, good example of wacky. / Absurd is shoving talk-show hosts into a toaster. / Even the ones that deserve it? / Well, sometimes absurdity is justifiable. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?184
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?185
Wacky is... / Can I do one? / Sure. / Wacky is mistaking bait for pasta. / Right.... / Absurd is strangling your grandmother's parakeet with its own intestines because it won't shut up about badminton. / I think you're missing the point. / But it's absurd, right? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?185
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?186
Wacky is getting drunk and thinking you're Robert Frost. / Absurd is turning into Robert Frost whenever you get drunk. / What about whenever you get angry? / Hmm... "The Incredible New Hampshire Poet". I see definite television possibilities. / See? Absurd is fun! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?186
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?187
Wacky is planting birdseed. / A classic. / Absurd is when it grows. / No, that's still wacky. / It is? / Definitely. It's not absurd until the eggplants hatch. / Good point. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?187
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?188
Well, Robert, you now have a firm grasp of the line between wacky and absurd. / I sure do, Triangle! / Are we going to change our current scheme to something a tad more sensible? / No. / I didn't think so. / And now back to our absurdity, already in progress. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?188
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?189
You win. I'll bury the ground pork. / Great! / And then some stuff that I don't bother to draw happens, and then... / That was one ticked-off vole. / Loves his mother, though. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?189
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?190
Okay, step four is we fly to the Capitol. / That's remarkably sane. / Go get the jetpacks. / Ah, there's the silly bit. / Why do you always say that like it's a bad thing? / To create dramatic conflict. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?190
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?191
I'll go order dance supplies for the fish while you get the jetpacks ready. / Um... I guess they're ready, it would help if I actually knew what I was doing.... / Or if I knew what jetpacks looked like.... / They don't normally carry fish sizes, but they'll special-order everything and rush deliver it since it's for a good cause. / What cause was that again? / I forget. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?191
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?192
Robert! How the fractal do you steer these things? / Um... / Why are we using jetpacks anyway? / Because it's funny! / We could have done some jokes about airline food! / Why didn't you point that out earlier? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?192
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?193
I'm turning my jetpack off. / What? / It's the only way down. The ground can't be that hard, considering it's never drawn. / Elegant reasoning. / That looks fun! / Yargh! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?193
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?194
I can still see Triangle down below. He's falling pretty fast. / I wonder how high we are. It's hard to tell without the ground being drawn. / THUMP! / Triangle? Are you okay? Can you hear me? / zootlewurdlezootlewurdle... / Cratery. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?194
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?195
Whoa. You got banged up pretty bad. / I'd better get you to a doctor. / No... I'll take you to an appliance repairman. That'll be funnier. / (I'm doomed.) http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?195
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?196
TRIANGLE. / What... who are you? Where am I? / BETWEEN WORLDS. YOU HAVE DIED. / Darn. / THE FALL INJURED YOU FATALLY. THE RHOMBUS TAKING YOU TO AN APPLIANCE REPAIRMAN DIDN'T HELP ANY EITHER. / Again: darn. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?196
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?197
That's... it then. He's dead. We hardly even knew each other, really. / Dead. Dead. Dead. / I can't think of anything funny to say for the third panel. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?197
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?198
My fault for coming up with this pointless scheme. My fault for wanting to use jetpacks. / My fault for not taking you to a hospital. Dead, dead, dead. / The fact that you're pretty blatantly going to come back to life in a few strips doesn't make me feel any better for some reason. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?198

What are you? / A MESSENGER. / Oh, great. More plot stuff. / YES. MORE "PLOT STUFF", AS YOU CHOOSE TO PUT IT. / And then I stop being dead? / PROBABLY. WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT IT ALL THROUGH. / Well. Gee. No rush. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?201
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?202
THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST TIME BETWEEN WORLDS. DO YOU REMEMBER? / Dimly. This all has something to do with pudding, right? / EVERYTHING HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH PUDDING. / Everything? / WELL, NOT REALLY. BUT THIS DOES. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?202
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?203
WHEN LAST YOU CAME HERE, YOU WERE LED BY A DIFFERENT MESSENGER. / Right. Her. / RIGHT, WELL...THAT SORT OF THING HAPPENS. SHE WAS A TEMP. / She explained absolutely nothing and then ran off for no apparent reason and stranded me! / SHE DOESN'T WORK HERE ANYMORE. / I'd hope not. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?203
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?204
NOW THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU TO KNOW YOUR DESTINY. / Well? / I...FORGOT MY LINE. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?204
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?205
OKAY, NOW THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU TO KNOW YOUR DESTINY. / You sure? / I THINK SO, UM... YES! NOW YOUR PURPOSE SHALL BE REVEALED! / BUT FIRST, LET'S ALL GIVE A BIG HAND TO OUR SPECIAL GUEST, ED... HUH? THIS ISN'T MY SCRIPT. WHAT IS THIS? / Pathetic. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?205
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?206
NOW THE TIME HAS REALLY COME FOR YOUR DESTINY TO BE REVEALED. / Sure it has. / YES. IT HAS. SO COME ON OVER TO CRAZY SAL'S NEW AND USED... THIS CAN'T BE IT. WHAT PAGE ARE WE ON? / Don't ask me. You're the one with the book of eternity. / UM... HAVE YOU GOTTEN TO THE BIT WITH THE VOLCANO YET? / You're worse than the temp. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?206
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?207
I'm sorry. This just isn't working. / You're telling me. / I actually did intend your destiny to be revealed this time. / Well, it can wait. You got a couple decent jokes out of it anyway. / Why is it I can never introduce a majestic godlike figure without him or her immediately turning into a bumbling moron? / You don't want me to answer that. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?207
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?208
Ow. / Triangle! You're alive! / Yeah... apparently the cartoonist (and I use the word loosely) couldn't draw the afterlife. / Figures. / We should do something about my injury... Ow. / I have a tire repair kit. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?208
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?209
I'm feeling a little better now... by the way, how did you get down from your jetpack? / Well, I sort of didn't. / I kept going up until I bumped into the ground from the bottom. / That either violates geometry or physics. / Both. I checked. It also violates geology, astronomy, and Keynesian economics. / How...no. I won't give you the gratification of asking. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?209
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?210
Are we anywhere near the next phase of your utterly pointless scheme? / We sure are. The Capitol's over there. Step five is to secretly switch the majority leader's coffee with these. / These aren't coffee crystals. / Dry ice is funnier. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?210
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?211
Can you do the last two steps? I still need to recover, and your plan's gotten too weird for me. / Sure. This should only take a couple hours. One warning though. / What? / If strange yellow rays start emanating from the Capitol dome... / Yes? / Hold extremely still. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?211
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?212
Get away from me with that melon! / Huh? That's no buffalo! / The bagels! Save the bagels! / Judging by the sounds of arbitrary mayhem, step six must be coming along. / That's...my...face! / Skunk! Skunk! / Who invited the yodeler? / We're out of fabric softener! / I am SO glad I don't know what step six actually is. / Pirates! / A ballet instructor! We're saved! / No, it's a fish! / Sign it anyway! / I hope no one tries to expain it to me. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?212
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?213
And so the fish-signing plotline ends not with a bang but with a sort of "thwarplookity-boing" sound. / THWARPLOOKITY-BOING! / There it is again. What keeps making that noise? / Oh... my... what IS that? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?213
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?214

Oh, in case you're wondering, the thing making the "thwarplookity-boing" sound two strips ago was just some guy saying "thwarplookity-boing". I didn't ask why. / Yes, I know it doesn't make any sense. Live with it. / ...I have to... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?215
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?216
The TV ad isn't helping. Business is still slow. / No one wants free monkeys. / If this slump keeps up, we'll need to get real jobs. / I think I just thought of a foolproof way to drum up some business. / A wacky scheme? / Not particularly. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?216
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?217
You sure this'll get business? / In a comic strip as clich?-ridden as this one, it can't fail. / I guess. / Come on, say it with me! / Opportunities for wacky schemes don't just suddenly fall from the sky! / Now, we wait. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?217
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?218
And...we wait. / We wait. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?218
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?219
I don't think this is working. / I guess opportunities for wacky schemes really DON'T just suddenly fall from the sky. / Ahh, there we go. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?219
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?220
Now to hatch it. / I don't think it's an egg. / I don't think so either, but I want to hatch it anyway. / Insert bemused attempt at logical reasoning. / Non-sequitur! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?220
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?221
You've been sitting on it long enough.... / You want a turn? / No, I don't want a turn. I mean it's obviously not going to hatch. / Sure you don't want a turn? / Well, okay, a short one. / Comfy, isn't it? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?221
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?222
In a forgotten temple high above the... no, it's far below the... or maybe... um.... / In a forgotten temple somewhere forgotten... / Huh? No, this isn't a temple, it's um... a large temple-shaped frozen-foods warehouse. Yup, this is in no way a forgotten temple or in any way connected to the mystery of the Fourth Race. Not at all. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?222
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?223
In a forgotten temple... / Temple? Where? I'm picking up ice cream. / Your cover's blown and you know it. / Cover? What cover? / Fine. In a forgotten frozen-foods warehouse which resembles an ancient temple only by sheer coincidence... / That's better. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?223
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?224
Yes. After all this searchin, I have found the object of my quest, I have found the, uh... / The fudge ripple. / What? Why are you looking at me like that? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?224

Toilet flushing action? / Toilet flushing action. / How come you get a ninja chop? / I'm pointier. / Right, that'd explain it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?226
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?227
Mortal! / Huh? Where? / This temple is not for the likes of you. / Temple? You mean this isn't a frozen-foods warehouse? Whoopsie! / That joke wasn't funny the first time. / Joke? Huh? Funny? Time? I... I don't know what you're talking about! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?227
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?228
Leave this place. / Never! / I am far too close to unlocking the lost secrets of the Fourth Race to turn back now. / Then you die. / No! I mean, um... I just came in here to use the mens' room! That's all! Really! Really! / Fifth arch on the right. / Thanks. / THEN you die. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?228
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?229
Are you done in there yet? I need to kill you. / Just another couple minutes. How do you flush this thing? / Sacrifice a chicken to it. / Oh. Got one I can use? / Just leave it. / Righty-ho. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?229
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?230
Hi. I just wanted to let you know that Robert and I will in fact be appearing in this plotline. / What? That's your important announcement? You ruined continuity for that? / You can't hear me, you're still in the temple. / Right. Sorry. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?230
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?231
Now what are you doing in there? / I'm trying to get the sink to work so I can wash my hands. / Well hurry it up. / You don't HAVE hands! I'm coming in there. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?231
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?232
Cornered in a lavatory in the largest surviving temple of the Fourth Race, I must escape the Pudding-Watcher. / Guarding the powerful secrets of this temple, I must stop the cube, for he knows not what he meddles with. / Drawing a very bad comic strip, I must find a better way to do recaps. / Yes. / Can't argue with that. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?232
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?233
I need a brilliant strategem to escape from this ancient restroom. / All I have is a confusing deus ex machina. / I'll take it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?233
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?234
Cube, you are mine. / Oh no! A confusing deus ex machina! / I'm saved! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?234
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?235
Okay, now that I've bailed you out of that, it's time to level with me. What's going on? / Um... you're the author. You don't already know? / I did, then you confused me with that ice-cream thing. / Sorry, it was a necessary precaution. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?235
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?236
Okay, just a quick recap, then you draw some ancient-templey stuff and I get on with the expedition. / Sure. / This may come as a shock to you, but I'm not really an ice-cream man. / I am entirely non-shocked. / I said "may". http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?236
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?237
In reality, I'm with TISCWSLABMUZ. / You mean The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies? / Oh, I always get those abbreviations mixed up. / I mean I'm with RDCLBA. / Which stands for? / I can't actually remember. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?237
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?238
RCDLBA is the government responsible for locating ancient civilizations and artifacts of immense power and covering them up. / Recently it has been discovered that the Fourth Race, once thought a primitive civilization of fractal-worshippers, were in fact as technologically advanced as our society today, possibly more so. / That seems awfully implausible. / You're the one who wrote it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?238
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?239
This temple is the largest surviving structure from the Fourth Race. / In it, it is theorized, are scientific achievements which could rock the foundations of modern thought. / My job is to make sure none of these achievements are intact when the archaeologists get here. At least, that was my job. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?239
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?240
During the course of my covering-up duties, I gradually realized that there was more going on than RDCLBA thought. / I could no longer in good conscience destroy polygonhood's link to the ancient past. / I began collecting the artifacts I was sent to destroy, and I studied them. / Shouldn't this strip have a joke in it? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?240
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?121
We can sneak in, or we can use big noisy weapons. We can't do both. / What if we got a really big silencer? / And now I try to tell you that won't work, then you go get one anyway and it works. Right? / Yeah, that's what I was thinking. / Okay... give me a minute. Um... hmm... okay, I'm ready. Robert, even if you somehow manage to get a giant silencer, how the asterisk could it silence an explosion? And for that matter... Should I keep going? / Nope, found one. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?121
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?122
Baa! / Intruders... excellent. / This gives me the perfect opportunity to test my latent new toy... the Ovinoculatron! / Baa baa? / I don't know what it does. If I did, I wouldn't need to test it, would I? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?122
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?123
Now THAT was a battle! / Too bad SOMEONE didn't bother to actually DRAW it! / Hey! I'm supposed to be the bitter one. You're the wacky one! / Sorry. Won't happen again. / This out-of-character moment brought to you by: / Inabilty to / Think Up a / Plot http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?123
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?124
Is it just me, or did the perimeter sheep seem just a little too eager to retreat? / Yeah... they must be expecting us inside. / So... we charge in anyway? / Let's have lunch first, then charge in. Get them off guard that way. / Sounds good. You up for Thai? / Sure. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?124
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?125
Where ARE they? / This waiting around for my enemies to attack can't be good for my blood pressure. / Uh-oh. Chest pains... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?125
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?126
A few hours later... / He's... head? What happened? / Heart failure. He wo lives by the MSG... dies by the MSG. / That's either profound or moronic. / It's over. There's nothing left to be done here. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?126
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?127
Well. I was hoping for something less anticlimactic, but at least it's over. / Yeah. Now we can get back to doing something funny. / You didn't happen to, say... actually check his pulse or anything like that? / Of course not. / Good. / Gotta keep those sequels open! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?127
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?128
You know. I've been thinking... / Wow. / I'm quitting this restaurant and going into business for myself. You with me? / Of course... but what are we qualified for? / A few months later... / "Triangle and Robert, Wacky Scheme Consultants". Just what I need. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?128
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?129
Triangle! A customer! / What? Here? Really? / Hi! Thank you for considering choosing Triangle and Robert as your wacky scheme consultants. You'll find that our rates are reasonable and our advice isn't. / How much do you know about cursed relics? / To be honest, next to nothing. / Perfect. Throw this into a volcano. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?129
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?130
If you want us to throw this cursed thingy into a volcano, we're going to need a little more information. / It's worth a ridiculous amount of money to me if you do. / Okay, that's all the information we need. Let's go, Triangle! / So. Where's the nearest volcano? / Um... Mount Scary, I think. / Of course. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?130
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?131
Well, it's off to Mount Scary! / Chosen One? Is that the... Could you possibly be holding the... it is! That's... that's... / What? / What? / What? Erm... nothing. I didn't say anything. No, never mind me. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?131
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?132
What is this thing, Orpuddex? What do you know about it? / No. Nothing. Haven't a clue. / Tell me! Why was Cube so eager to get rid of whatever it is? / No idea. Honest. Nothing to do with me. No way. / Fine. See you later. / Um... can I come along? And watch? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?132
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?133
Should we take Orpuddex with us? / Of course not. He's my archenemy, or something like that. / Pretty please? / Sure. / What? / Think about it. Even if he wanted to hurl us screaming into the flaming crater of Mount Scary, it's not like he'd be able to. None of us have arms. / Reassuring. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?133
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?134
Listen. Author? I just want to let you know, in advance, that the fact that we're going to throw a cursed relic into a volcano does not give you the right to do a Lord of the Rings parody. / Of course not. I wasn't planning on one. / Okay. I just wanted to be sure. / We hatesss rhombussess! Give usss our birthday presssent! / This better be a one strip joke. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?134
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?135
What does Cube do for a living, anyway? / Hmm. Good question. / I'm thinking he's an archeologist or a spy. / No. He's probably an ice-cream man. / Do I want to know the line of reasoning that led to that statement? / There wasn't one. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?135
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?136
Halfway to the peak of Mount Scary... / What? We're halfway there already? / Yeah. It's a rather small volcano. / Rather pathetic volcano, you mean. / Either it's a small volcano or you spend the next half-dozen strips climbing. / Fine. / Small is good. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?136
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?137
Hey! Where'd the cursed relic doohickey go? / And where's Orpuddex? / Oh. Okay, hands up everyone who didn't see this coming! / We don't have hands. / Right. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?137
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?138
Orpuddex! Get back here with that... thing. / Never! I had thought it long since destroyed... at times I doubted that it even existed... and now it is mine! / And... what is it exactly? / I'm not telling. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?138
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?139
Orpuddex! ORPUDDEX!! / Let him go. / What? / He's a recurring character. We're bound to meet up with him again. / Yeah, but he has the thingy, and he's like kinda evil or something, and... / Okay, okay. We'll follow him. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?139
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?140
At a crude altar high on the somewhat forbidding slopes of Mount Scary... / Yes! / After all the waiting, I can finally make amends! / Once more this universe shall truly be... a universe... of pudding! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?140
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?141
Over there! I think I see him! / Oh, yeah... no, that's a rock. Over there! / Rock. / Oh. Sorry. / This would be a lot easier if we had color. / There's a really cool-looking rock over there. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?141
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?142
There! Orpuddex! / No, I think that's a tree. / Author? Little help? / Umm... okay. / The Fourth Race? / Is that the luge? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?142
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?143
Garktor, demon of nine cosmoses, hear my call! / Please deposit 25 gold pieces for the first three minutes. / What? Darn, it's a pay altar. I must have some ancient change on me... / Beep beep beep beep... / Nope. I'm gonna have to go get some. There's no way I'm summoning a demon collect. / beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?143
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?144
Hmm. This is where Orpuddex brought the... whatever. / Do you think it's... no, of course it's not safe to touch, but we're gonna touch it anyway. / We have to. You first. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?144
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?145
Stupid altar... I'm about to summon Garktor of the Nine Cosmoses and the thing beeps at me and requires correct change... / Wait a second! I was the Pudding-Watcher! I'm the oldest and most legendary thing in this entire universe! What am I doing looking for change to make a call? / I'm... I'm comical and bumbling! What has HAPPENED to me? It's the cartoonist's fault, that's what it is... / Uh oh. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?145
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?146
Author! Redraw me! / Why should I? / As it is now, my appearance inspires little more than laughter. Draw me so that I will strike menace into all who look upon me. / And what if I don't? / I will show you fear in a handful of instant pudding mix. / I think I'll take my chances. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?146
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?147
You should not trifle with me. I was once the Pudding-Watcher, and much of my power yet remains. / Like what? / You doubt my mastery of pudding? Go then, mortal, and look within your fridge. / GAAAAGH! It's horrible! You win, you win! / ... but I haven't done anything yet... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?147
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?148
Okay, I'll make you scary. / What do you have in mind? / How about if instead of just the two eyes, you're covered with a bunch of different-sized eyes all over? / Sounds good. Do it. / Good grief! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?148
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?149
Listen! I'm supposed to be a brooding, dark character! / Dark? / Dark. Make me dark. / That's not what I meant and you know it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?149
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?150
Okay, on the count of three we pick the thing up. One.... Two.... / Three! / Huh? It didn't explode or zap us or anything. / We must have done it wrong. Let's pick it up again. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?150

At last. The top of Mount Scary. / Now to chuck this thing in the... / Oh. Sorry. Forgot to draw the crater. / Well? / Give me a minute. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?158
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?159
Well? / Crater? / Hello? Draw the crater so we can get on with the plot? / We need a big flaming pit! / This is stupid. Again. / Author? Where'd you go? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?159
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?160
I'm back. / Did you bring a crater? / A small one'll do. / Crater. Right. That's what I was supposed to do. / Then what were you doing? / I came up with some great new characters for you to play with! / Play? / Should we start screaming now? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?160
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?161
Hi! I'm Prozac the Bear! / (whimper) / You're a bear? / cartoonist'sgonnapay cartoonist'sgonnapay... / Technically, it's Bear the Prozac, but it sounds better the other way. / cartoonist'sgonnapay... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?161
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?162
I'm Prozac the Bear! / I'm Prozac the Bear! / I'm Prozac the Bear! / CARTOONIST'S GONNA PAY! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?162
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?163
(seethe seethe) / I know what you need! / Know what? Know what? I know what I need too! / Ow! That's my - Hey! You're pointy! Stop - Yowch! Arrr! Oh my - my - ...ag... / Triangle? / I feel much better now. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?163
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?164
Okay, so Prozac the Bear wasn't what I expected. Let's introduce the next new character: MR. SOAP! / A talking bar of soap? / Talking? Er... no. / Not talking? A mime made of soap? / Um, no... just a bar of soap. Here's an idea, we'll skip that one for now. / Maybe the bar of soap should draw the comic strip. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?164
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?165
Okay, fine, here you go. A crater. / This is going to be something stupid, isn't it. / Cratery. / Could be worse. / Okay, toss it. / Bye-bye, thing that our neighbour gave us that we don't know what it is! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?165
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?166
It should be hitting bottom any moment now. / It should go sizzle any second. / THUMP / Thump? / It should be a sizzle, or at least a sploosh-fizz. / Any idea what's wrong? / Yeah! This crater doesn't have any lava in it! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?166
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?167
All this way and the volcano's... empty. / Should we write an angry letter? / Not worth the bother. We threw the relic in the volcano, we're done. / Orpuddex'll take it the moment we leave. / Let him. He's a bumbling inept villian anyway. / True, and besides, he doesn't have any arms. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?167
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?168
Well Cube, we threw the whatsit into the crater of Mount Scary. / One slight problem though... / Ssh! / No. No problems. Orpuddex got in the way, but we got around him. / Orpuddex? The Pudding-Watcher walks upon the earth? / Well... yeah. / Haven't you been reading the back strips? / The Time of the Oval is at hand! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?168
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?169
What did Cube mean by the Time of the Oval? / No idea. If it's important we'll learn more about it later. / You know... that last job wasn't really consulting work. We're supposed to be wacky scheme consultants, but.... / Yeah! And it wasn't wacky either! / For that matter it barely qualified as a scheme. / Paid well though. / Oh, yeah, the pay was great. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?169
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?170
Hi! Welcome to Triangle and Robert Wacky Scheme Consultants! How may we serve you? / I hope you'll understand that I can't tell you the whole story.... / Oh, of course. We have a stunning lack of discretion here at T&RWSC. Anything important you told us would end up in the hands of your enemies almost immediately. / That's a rather, um... honest thing to tell a potential client. / As I said, no sense of discretion. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?170
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?171
To cut a long story so short it'll fit in one panel and not make any sense whatsoever, I need two-thirds of the Senate to autograph my fish by Tuesday. / Now that's wacky! We'll do it~ / ~? / Sorry, I was so excited about you having a new case I mistyped. That was supposed to be an exclamation point. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?171
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?172
Well, Triangle, I've come up with a six-step plan to give this client what he wants. / I have to go along with it, of course. / Step one: Convince the fish it's a ballet instructor. Step two: / HOLD IT! / Why don't you tell me the plan step by step as we go. That way the shock will be spread out and I'll be less likely to spontaneously combust. / Actually, you spontaneously combusting WAS step two, but I can change that. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?172
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?173
Author? I'm just wondering... how are you going to be able to draw the Senate? / I mean, that really seems to be beyond your, um... artistic inability. / I'm still trying to figure out how to draw the fish. / Oh goody. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?173
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?174
You are becoming tired.... You can feel your thoughts drifting far, far away.... / Robert? You can't hypnotize it. / You are asleep now.... When you awaken, you will no longer be as you are.... / Robert? It doesn't know what you're saying. / When you awaken, you will feel an uncontrollable urge.... When you awaken, you will feel the need to teach ballet! / Robert? It's a fish. / No! It's a ballet instructor! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?174
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?175
What makes you think that a fish actually believes it's a ballet instructor? / Don't ask. It's silly and it would just make you angry. / Does it have anything to do with... / The interdimensional portal and the box of rubber pretzels? Sort of. / You're right. It would just make me angry. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?175
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?176
Okay, now what's step two? / We teach our new client to read and write fluent New Hampshire. / That's just as stupid as having me spontaneously combust. And New Hampshire isn't a language, it's a state. / A state... or a state of mind? / A state. / I take it you mind. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?176
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?177
While I take care of step two, you can get started on step three. / Yes. Or, I could attempt to cling to the fleeting shred of sanity I have remaining. / Okay. While you're clinging, could you order a couple gross of kazoos? / No. No, I couldn't. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?177
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?178
We're falling behind our timetable here. We've got to get this fish through the Senate in four days! / Okay, okay, what do I need to do? / Bury this bag of ground pork. / And this will help because... / It has a radio transmitter in it. / Of course. It's blindingly obvious now, isn't it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?178
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?179
No. I'm not ordering a couple gross of kazoos, I'm not burying a bugged bag of ground pork, I'm not going to dress as a giant strawberry, and this idea with the dry ice sculpture of Richard Vernon goes beyond moronic. / Whoa. / This so-called "plan" of yours is a concatenation of random allegedly "wacky" steps with little humor value, no plot value, and a vast but unfortunately negative degree of utility. / But... but... it's wacky! / No. It's absurd and pointless. / That's just as good! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?179
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?180
We agreed to go into this business together. This is what wacky scheme consultants do. You know that. / There's a difference between wacky and absurd. / No there isn't. / But Robert was wrong. There was indeed a difference between wacky and absurd, and we'll be exploring that difference in a new series starting next strip. / In other words, prepare for padding. / You know me so well. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?180
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?361
[[The letters spell out 'HELP US']] / Whoa. / Get away from there! You're bothering the letters! / I had no idea spelling bee letters were mistreated like this. / They ain't mistreated, it's better than they'd get in the wild! / "Ain't"? Sir, with grammar like that, you have no business running a spelling bee. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?361
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?362
Hello, police? I'd like to report twenty-five counts of cruelty to letters. / And we care why? / This is Triangle. I did your job for you at the Tater Fizz plant, remember? You owe me. / Fine, we'll send an officer around sometime next month. / The spelling bee won't be in town next month. / Oh, the spelling bee? I think that's outside our jurisdiction. / It's two blocks down from police headquarters! / Oh, so it is. Whoopsie. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?362
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?363
In a surprising turn of events, the police actually arrested someone today. Unpronounceable Foreign-Sounding Name, spelling bee proprietor, / is being held without bail on charges of operating a fusion generator without a license, transporting hazardous octagons across state lines, and multiple counts of cruelty to letters. / Robert, why are you watching the radio on TV? / The reception's more fun. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?363
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?364
The spelling bee needs temporary management, and wacky scheme business has been pretty slow. Think we could handle it? / One letter is enough. I'm sure they'll find someone competent. / Dog! / What IS the deal with that thing? / It's cute, that's all I know. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?364
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?365
There's someone at the door. Go see who it is. / We have a door? / Let's say we do for the sake of argument. / Don't let it in. / Why? Who is it? / I think it's my fear of success. / You can't keep me out forever! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?365
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?366
It broke the door down. / We have a door? / Not anymore. / Comic strip... to many readers... to much pressure... gotta cut readership... / No! That's just your fear of success talking! / Stay good, cartoonist! Stay good! / Poing! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?366

The Keenspot alliance appears beneficial to cartoonists at first glance, but after a few years Keepspot strips will be as entrenched and stale as newspaper strips. / Plus, by requiring Keepspot links to be in place, the alliance implicitly discourages member strips from acknowledging the existence or quality of non-Keenspot strips. / Boycott Keenspot! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?373
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?374
Go away! Stop reading!

It's over. We're back to normal. / That was bad. / By my count, I've alienated people with low bandwidth, Buddhists, atheists, Americans, non-Americans, blacks, whites, the sexually active, authors and readers of Keenspot strips, and people who boycott things. / And people who can draw. / I alienated them long ago. / And people who like jokes. / And geometry professors. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?375

Equilateral one, we must talk. / Sure. What's up? / The Pudding-Watcher's power grows in the depths. He is weak, but he will soon become strong. Train with me, Triangle. I can help you survive the confrontation to come. / I am neither a warrior nor a chef. I will deal with Orpuddex in my own way, if he needs to be dealt with. / Come to me if your mind changes. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?377
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?378
I will not train under you, but you can help me. Tell me what you know of the Pudding-Watcher. / Pudding lies not within vegetable, nor in meat, nor in grain or dairy. Pudding lies outside the Four. / What about the Fats and Sugars group? / Speak not to me the heresy of the Food Pyramid! / If it is a heresy, why do you fear it so? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?378
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?379
I will not speak of the falsehoods of the Pyramid. Goodbye. / Huh? / What's so bad about the Food Pyramid? / The Food Pyramid? They say it once shot a trapezoid just to watch him die. / What? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?379
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?380
The Food Pyramid suddenly came into the public eye a few years ago. It preached a dietary philosophy at odds with the orthodox doctrine of four food groups. / And then it snapped, went on a twelve-country killing spree, was arrested, convicted and imprisoned. End of story. / I never heard about the killing spree. / Well, we didn't exist at the time. I only learned about it just now, to give the exposition. / Someday I'm going to be rich, and I'm going to buy a fourth wall. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?380
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?381
That doesn't explain why the mere mention of the Fats and Sugars group... / I bet the Food Pyramid killed his grandmother. / Maybe. / Gleep! / What is it boy? You say the Food Pyramid was framed? No? Oh, you want to go for a walk. I'll get the leash. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?381
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?382
All the puddings of the world... / They flow through me here... / Yuck. Tapioca. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?382
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?383
I suppose you want me to try to clear the Food Pyramid's name now for some obscure reason. / We can do it a different way. / This just in. The Food Pyramid has... escaped from prison? Huh? What was it in prison for? It did WHAT? I don't remember hearing anything about any killing spree. / Anyway, authorities are on the lookout for a triangle, roughly equilateral, possibly dyed white. / Wow, real subtle way to direct the plot, mister Shakespeare. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?383
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?384
Okay, you're clearly going to force me to go along with this plotline no matter what I think, so just tell me what I'm supposed to do next. / You go to the library and do some research about the killings, uncovering a startling discovery. / Can you just tell me what the discovery is so we can skip to the next bit? / No, but I'll fast-forward to the end of the library scene. / Whee! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?384
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?385
And no birth record either. That's the last of them. There's no record of any of these murder victims up until the death certificates. / Either all evidence of their ever having existed was destroyed... or they never existed. No sign of parents, friends, schooling, employment... nothing but names on death certificates. / Sir, could you give your exposition more quietly? / Sorry. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?385
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?386
Next I interview people in the hometowns of the alleged victims. / That we can skip over. / None of them knew the victims. Most didn't know what you were talking about at first. It appears that no such murders took place. The really strange thing is the near-total silence of the local news media at the time. / So one way or another there's a cover-up. The question now is what really happened and why. / Stop! You're under arrest. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?386
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?387
This is the twelfth time I've been arrested over this thing. Look, I'm not the Food Pyramid. This isn't dye and my measurements aren't the same. / Your story checks out. Sorry about the bother. / You know, there's something really messed up about all this. I don't think the Food Pyramid was the real killer. / I don't think there was any real killer. The victims were fake. / That would explain a couple things. Don't tell anyone I said this, but you might want to check out the International Culinary Institute. / Why? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?387
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?388
I've said way too much already. If I tell you any more and I'm wrong, it would mean my job. / I guess half a lead is better than none. / The International Culinary Institute. The world's most influential food bureaucracy. If they took exception to the Food Pyramid's teachings. / It's too much. I'm in over my head. / You don't have a head. / You're right. I'll check it out. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?388
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?389
Too much tapioca. It's wrong. / There are only three things this could mean. Two are bad. / I don't want to think about the third. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?389
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?390
Triangle's been gone for a while now. I'm bored. / I know! I'll run for governor! / Woof? / Don't be silly! Of COURSE you can be my campaign manager. / Spin! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?390
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?331
Cartoonist Guy... their strip... was that... you? / No. No more so than you are. / Me? Me... you... my... / Problem? / Being a fictional character is hard to get used to. / Yeah, it is. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?331
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?332
So I create Dot and Other Dot, then they create Cartoonist Guy, who creates the Beforings, who created this whole universe to begin with. / Ignoring for the moment the fact that this is a gross violation of causality, it's very confusing. / Well, I guess it would be, if any of this were actually happening. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?332
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?333
So how'd the comic strip experiment go? / Don't talk to me. / Okay, I guess I'll be walking the dog then if you need me. / I won't. / We have a dog? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?333
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?334
Uh, Robert? Robert! / That's not a dog! / Oh yeah? If it's not a dog, what is it? / It's an inverted capital G. / Really? / Woof! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?334
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?335
Where did that thing come from anyway? / It followed me home from the library. / They let you back into the library? / "Let"? / Bow wow! / Oh no. Do I want to hear this? / Only you can answer that question. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?335
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?336
They didn't "let" me into the library, they were just too busy with the fire to stop me. / "The fire". / Hey! I didn't start the fire! / Oh, it was always burning since the world's been turning? / Oh... my... did I just say that? / It happens. You'll have forgotten all about it by the next strip. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?336
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?337
The fire started in the room where the library kept historical documents. / Historical documents? / Maybe... when the oversized replica Emancipation Proclamation burst into flame... it wasn't the bottling plant defenses. / Then... what? / Maybe... maybe it's some sort of global conspiracy to rewrite history... some conspiracy so vast and far-reaching I couldn't care less about it. / Oh, one of those. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?337
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?338
So, what are we going to do about that inverted capital G? / Are you positive it's not a dog? / I mean, it says "bark" and "woof" and everything! / Yip yip yip. / Exactly! It says the word "woof" very clearly! That's not barking! / Uh-huh... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?338
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?339
Please, can't we keep it? / Yes. We can keep it. But what does it eat? How do we take care of it? / I'd guess we'd feed it Alpha-Bits, or would that be cannibalism? / Arf, arf! / While consistent with the general logic underlying comic strips such as this one, feeding it cereal will probably make it throw up. / Then we're agreed. We feed it Alpha-Bits. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?339
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?340
Meanwhile, beyond time and space, well not "meanwhile" I guess since it's beyond time, but I had to say something to establish the scene... / Phase One has been achieved. / You mean...? / Yes. We have puddogenesis. / Good. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?340
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?341
Well, it's been a year. Happy birthday. / Do we get a present? / Such as limbs? / Or eyes? Eyes would be nice. / Color? Is it color? / No, but you're getting warmer... See you on Sunday. / Sunday, but it's not color... / Maybe we'll go shopping for clothes! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?341
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?342
You want to play fetch? Yeah? Yeah? Go get it! / Ruff! / Robert, what did you just throw? / Just some generic circle I found lying around. / That wasn't the circle I was thawing for tonight's supper, was it? / I'd bet money on it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?342
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?343
With supper ruined, we have but one choice. / Yay! Restaurant time! / Can we take the dog? / I'm not leaving it here alone, who knows what it'll do. And it's not a dog. / Only one restaurant in the neighborhood allows pets. You don't need me to tell you which. / Well, we knew we'd have to go back there eventually. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?343

[[A shopfront: / THE LOCUST GARDEN / AUTHENTIC CHINESE CUISINE / In the windows are signs: / HELP WANTED / MENU]] / Hey, they fixed the sign. / And it doesn't smell like nail polish and gophers. / And look inside! None of the food is moving! / This does not bode well. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?344
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?345
The place actually looks nice for a change. What happened? / Oh! Triangle! Hello! Yes, we've undergone a complete refactoring. / Why? Your inedible chunks were making money hand over fist, and the health inspectors were afraid to set foot in here. / Look around you, Triangle. What do you see? / People eating... enjoying themselves... talking about things other than who's having a worse time... it's an actual restaurant someone could take a date to. / I mean in the other direction. The big gold statue. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?345
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?346
Oh yeah. Nice statue. / That statue holds the spirit of my grandmother. / She was one of the last of the nomadic warrior-chefs. Her spatula was feared as far away as Denmark. My MSG-laden departure from the way of the warrior-chef awakened her from her rightful slumber. / To appease her spirit, I remade this restaurant in the image of the great dojo-cafes, using my family's ancestral recipes. / Pudding is involved somehow, of course. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?346

Well, it's Sunday. Where's the big surprise? / Look around! We have color! / No, we have... grey. / Grey's a color! / Well?

I'm reporting live from outside the Tater Fizz bottling plant. Witnesses claim to have seen a / giant screaming pill entering the plant two days ago. Since then, no one has entered or left the bottling plant. It appears that the local supply of / the popular potato-flavored soft drink has been cut off. / Triangle! We've got a situation! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?271
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?272
Tater Fizz is the most vile beverage ever conceived. As far as I'm concerned Prozac's doing the city a favor. / But what about the children? / Huh? / All the children, being deprived of their murky white carbonated potato... juice... cocktail.... You're right. No one in their right mind drinks Tater Fizz. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?272
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?273
If they're not in Austria then where are they? / Shh. I'm listening to this. / It's day four of the Tater Fizz crisis and there has as yet been no communication of any kind from inside the plant. Police believe there may be a hostage situation in progress but don't feel like doing anything about it. / In other news, the government is denying both the disappearance of the RDCLBA and the fact that said agency ever existed to begin with. And now, weather. / What was your question again? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?273
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?274
I represent a group of several very stupid rich people with no sense of taste. / Howdy. / For some unfathomable reason, my clients actually want the Tater Fizz supply restored, and you're the polygons for the job. / What are they offering? / An extremely large crate of various sparkly things. / I'll have to talk it over with my partner, but it sounds like you've got yourselves a deal. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?274
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?275
A new development in the Tater Fizz situation: local wacky scheme consultants Triangle and Robert have just been seen entering the bottling plant carrying an oversized copy of the Emancipation Proclamation. / Hey! Turn off the radio for a second! I need to know where the teleporter sent everyone! / Shh! Listening! News! / Huh? Did my radio just turn into some kind of spider? / That's an explosion. Now talk. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?275
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?276
Having been repulsed by the language barrier, they would naturally emerge from teleportation at the least Austrian point on the planet. / You mean... / No. I don't. / You sure? I really want to go to... / Well, that's not where they are. / Pity. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?276
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?277
Okay, then where is the least Austrian point on the planet? / Will you replace my radio if I tell you? / Of course. / Okay. You'll find them at the core of the planet. / Which core? Your planet is shaped funny, you know. / The 4D hypertaco was your idea, not ours. Anyway, they're in the molten pudding core. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?277
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?278
Do you mean to tell me half my cast has been immersed in molten pudding for a week? / At this point, "dissolved" would be more accurate. / So... they're dead? / Except for Orpuddex, yes. / Well. That makes things easier. It's a lot less work to bring characters back from the dead than to find them when they're lost. / Now give me my radio back. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?278
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?279
Oh no! The Emancipation Proclamation is on fire! / Let's get out of here! / Triangle and Robert are now coming out of the bottling plant.... They're running.... They seem to be carrying something. It's on fire.... I think it's the oversided copy of the Emancipation Proclamation! It appears that the wacky scheme consultants have met their match. / Not necessarily. You can tell your listeners that we'll be going back in there, and this time we'll bring enough cotton swabs. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?279
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?280
Okay, strategy time. What exactly went wrong? / There weren't enough cotton swabs. / Yes, but we shouldn't have needed the cotton swabs in the first place. What started the flooding? / The Emancipation Proclamation was too big? / Exactly. / This time, we use the Magna Carta. / And we fireproof it. / Bingo. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?280
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?281
It's day eight of the Tater Fizz crisis. So far, Triangle and Robert have made six attempts to penetrate the bottling plant's fortress-like defenses. Each attempt has ended with a lot of screaming and something being set on fire. / It appears that they are preparing for a seventh attempt. This time, rather than carrying an oversized copy of a historical document, they'll be using live squid. Hopefully this change of plan will lead to success. / WHY? WHY does a bottling plant for a soda no one sane drinks have automated defenses that make Area 51 look like a miniature golf course? / Maybe they like miniatrue golf? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?281

It's our only chance! The lasers will be back online any minute now! / Exorcise him sure, but we're not using potato products to do it! / Then what? / You still have a couple squid left? / Oh! Of course! Exorcise irrational fear of potatoes witha pair of squid! / See what I'm getting at? / No! Not in the slightest! / Just hand me the cephalopods and hide behind something. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?284

Hey Robert, I found the bottling plant workers! / What happened here? / That crazy pill charged in here and started locking us up. Said it was to protect us from the potatoes. What's going on?

Dragon Circle number two, simple enough. Are we going to have to go through every single Dragon Circle one at a time? / Are you suggesting that I take some sort of shortcut rather than tell the full scope of this epic tale? / Yes. / Well too bad. I've been slacking off far too much recently. I'm not going to have any more holes in my story. / You can't be serious. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?482
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?483
And so, twenty-three pointlessly brief and repetitive subquests later, Triangle at last comes to the twenty-fifth Dragon Circle. / I knew it. / Okay, so one more to go and then we can get the ludicrously overforeshadowed pun out of the way. / One more? No, you found all twenty-five. / You mean you're not going to... / Oh! You thought I was going to do THAT? No way! I'm a bad cartoonist, but I'm not SADISTIC! / Somehow, evading the pun just makes it worse. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?483
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?484
And now that you have all twenty-five Dragon Circles, you can summon the Dragon and make 1d6+7 wishes! / 1d6+7? / I don't have a six-sided die. / Oh, I'll wish Cube back first. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?484
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?485
Funky! I'm being wished back! / Why you? Why not me? / Triangle needs a six-sided die to count his wishes. I'm sure you'll be next. / But you don't have spots! / We'll think of something. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?485
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?486
That is not a regulation six-sided die. / I have six-sides and I was dead. I'll do. / Very well. Eight wishes remain to you, shape. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?486
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?487
For my second wish, I want Robert back. / The rhombus? Well, it is not my job to ask why. / It is done. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?487
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?488
Okay! Next wish! I want every episode of Leave it to Beaver, including lost ones, to be restored, recovered, and released on DVD at affordable prices. / That is within my power, but it will count as seven wishes. / Of course. I thought it might. / It is done. / Robert.... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?488
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?489
Robert... you used up... ALL my remaining wishes... to... restore... a television program... that you hardly ever WATCH! / We could have wished for LIMBS! EYES! For crying out loud, we probably could have even wished for ANTIALIASED FONTS! What were you think? / So you don't want to see the one where they adopt Mel Torme? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?489
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?490
For that matter... for that matter... we don't have a DVD player.... / Berate the rhombus later. The Starham has vanished. / I just got BACK from an artifact run! / The Starham must be kept safe, equilateral one. / Why? / It's a ham, and it's from space. Isn't that enough reason? / No? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?490
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?491
You have to understand, I really believe in the ICI. The traditions they preserve are vital to polygonal existence. / But... not Meat Enforcement. The things that get said about the ICI as a whole... they're true of that one department. If the Meat Enforcers get hold of the Starham, who knows what could happen? / I don't know, who? / Rhetorical question. / Sorry. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?491
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?492
Since you're not going to shut up, tell me. What is the Starham? / A fully-cooked glazed ham which fell from space, intact, roughly forty years ago. / So? Meat falls from space all the time. / Meat, yes. But not CURED meat. / And that matters? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?492
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?493
The ICI never had possession of the Starham, and never sought it. The Starham has been studied in many independent laboratories. / Is that relevant? / Yes! You must understand, the International Culinary Institute is not your enemy. It is only the corrupt Meat Enforcers who pursue the ham for their own ends. / What ends? / There is much power in the Starham. / Like what? / Just... power. Not any kind in particular. / Oh, really. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?493
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?494
I suppose I should ask about the Meat Enforcers. / The department began as quality advisors, aiding meat producers in meeting standards. They then gained enforcement powers. Now, they ensure consistently high-grade meats worldwide through a campaign of brutal intimidation. / That's terrifying, but mainly silly. / If they are not behind the Starham's disappearance, they will certainly seek it. / Oh, this was supposed to be in greyscale. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?494
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?495
Why me? This Starham business seems more in Cube's line. / You need the experience, and the cube already intends a quest of his own. Something to do with aged pepper, I gather. / I don't like quests! Can't Cube do both? / Linda Concarne! Meat Enforcement! / Huh? / Come with me! I'm declaring you unfit for consumption! / Can you do that? I'm not meat. / Shut your mouth! / I don't have a mouth. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?495
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?496
In a frozen locker... / Stop talking back to me! Tell me where I can find the Starham! / / I don't mean LITERALLY stop talking back to me! Don't be smart! / I'm used to things not making sense, but I usually at least know WHY they don't make sense. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?496
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?497
I don't have the Starham! What made you think I do? / Don't twist my words! I never said you had it! / They call you the Chosen One! I don't believe in any of that, but you obviously have a power! You can see in the colors of magic, Triangle! Now tell me! Where is the Starham? / Wow. You are SO wrong on SO many counts. / Then I'll just have to turn this locker down a couple notches and let you freeze for a while! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?497
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?498
I'm trapped. Except... this locker is full of meat. I must know some meat spell I can use that would get me out of here. / And so Triangle hastily forms a pentagram of sausage and begins to chant. / Wait! I haven't even thought of a spell yet! / Right. / Now, how much fluid pressure would I get if I converted all the organ meats to gravy?... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?498
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?499
So, what's IN this peppermill you're so eager to recover? / I don't know anymore. / When I was dead, it was obvious. I don't have that perspective now, and the memories have faded. / Should I come with you? / The Wiggly Lines of Sorrow are no place for a wacky rhombus. I shouldn't have sent you the first time. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?499
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?500
Meats form in space. It's a decent-sized universe, and the remaining particles of pudding give all kinds of food formation a head start. / Space is no place for curing, though. Salts just don't form in the right concentrations. The Starham is an enigma, a properly cured ham... from the stars. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?500
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?501
Of course, Triangle has no more to do with the actual disappearance of the Starham than the ICI does. The RDCLBA also has no connection to this event. / I was planning to acquire the ham, but was beaten to it by forces unknown. / And somewhere in the skies, in a certain mysterious oval, a sandwich is made. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?501
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?502
Miss Concarne! We have an observation report. A bone has landed near Denver. / A bone? / Yes. It appears that the Starham... has been eaten. The bone was discarded from an unidentified small aircraft. / Get the jet ready! We're going after it! / And the triangle? / He'll freeze or he'll escape! We don't need him anymore! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?502
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?503
By the power of stuffing, I command you to open! / *POP* / I'm out! Thank goodness that door was chemically similar to turkey. / Nice move. / I guess I should stow away on that jet to advance the plot. / Cool, one less device for me to write. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?503
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?504
It's the year 2001 and I've got a bone and a black rectangle. Uh... now what? / Are you serious? You're stuck? / Uh, yeah. You'd think a gratuitous one-strip parody would write itself. / One-strip. So this whole Starham thing wasn't just setup for an idiotic sight gag. / No. I am going somewhere with the ham thing. / Then skip the unnecessary pop-culture reference and get on with it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?504
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?505
There's the bone! Land here! / We've already landed. / We've already left the jet, too. It's over there. / I see! Thank you for that lesson in the perils of stealth technology! / Does Wonder Woman have these problems? / I wouldn't know, Miss Concarne. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?505
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?506
Ah. Much of the power of the Starham remains in this... Starbone! I feel it! / I can sense that so-called Chosen One nearby! He's in the jet! / (great energy flowing from bone into Linda Concarne) / I also sense... no! It's impossible! Or... / Miss Concarne? Your orders? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?506
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?507
(She's spotted me.) / Chosen One! The bone is yours! Take it, quickly! Use the jet! Leave us here! Do it quickly, before I weaken! / (Ah, yes. What would a plot be without goofy twists?) / (What have I done... my whole life... I was... I was...) http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?507
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?508
And then I took her advice and left before she finished her internal monologue. / She must have a very interesting story to tell. / In this strip? / Right. Well.... Anyway, do you have the remains of the Starham with you? / Yes. I have the bone. I wonder what could have eaten the ham. / According to last Sunday's strip, an inhabitant of the Oval. / Hey! That's cheating! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?508
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?509
I still don't sense any power in this bone. / Maybe all the power was already transferred to that Linda Concarne. / No. It is a subtle, slow-roasted power, detectable to those closely attuned with meat. I can only dimly sense it myself. / Well, it's out of the hands of the Meat Enforcers, and we can put it with the other relics and artifacts we're guarding. That reminds me, Robert, did you get that cursed thingy back from Mount Scary? / Yeah, it's with the Arc of the Cosecant. / I told you never to mention that thing during the strip. It's embarassing. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?509
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?510
You're back! I've been worried sick! / Woof woof. / Why are you being chased by robots? / Bark whimper growl. / Well, all's well that ends well. I'll go get the flamethrower and finish them off. / Rouf. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?510

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?453
It's the Time of the Oval, or near it. The Pudding-Watcher erupted from a volcano and flooded our home city. / Then finally my training will be put to use! What form has the Watcher taken? / Um... he's a big... ghost-thingy... / A colossal eagle dripping green fire from its talons? / No. Sort of the opposite of that, really. / Can you be more specific? / No, I can't. You'll understand why when you see him. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?453
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?454
There aren't any flights back. All the runways back home are puddinged. / Please don't use "pudding" as a verb. / How about as a packing material? / No. / As a wind instrument? / Maybe, but not right now. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?454
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?455
There aren't any flights back. All the runways back at home are covered with pudding. / How else can we get back with the Vegetable Sentry? / I will teach you a spell. With this magic, you will be able to speak with ground spices. / How will that get us home? / What? It won't. I was just making conversation. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?455
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?456
Well, we made it back to the city. / That was a great plan, Triangle! / What? You found a way back? What did I miss? / I'm not telling. / To the bottling plant, faithful parasites! Mush! / Come on! Tell me! / After we reach Mr. Disease. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?456
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?457
You have returned! Is that the Vegetable Sentry with you? / Yes. / How did you accomplish your task so quickly? / We sort of took a shortcut back. / Come on! Tell us what it was already! / Yes! Tell us! / I pretended we were already here and the cartoonist fell for it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?457
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?458
... You tricked me into having you be back home by pretending to already be there so I'd draw you with Mr. Disease. Clever. / Now you're gonna get even, right? / No, it was funny, it was a fair move. This time. Try it again and it won't work. / The way you reuse jokes, I'm sure you'll still think it's funny next time I do it. / Funny, yes, but... uh... what was my point? / Like I ever know. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?458
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?459
I have many questions about those two and about what happened while I was in meditation. First, though, I will fight the Pudding-Watcher. / Alone? Are not all four sentries required to defeat the Watcher? / Not until it enters its battle form. From what those two told me, it has not yet done so. / Battle form? / You are a warrior-chef, yet you do not know of puddic transformation? / I'm not a very GOOD warrior-chef. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?459
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?460
Did you see that? The Vegetable Sentry and Mr. Disease got all shiny for a few minutes! / Either the cartoonist got carried away with gradients... / Or the're building up tremendous power! / Probably just the cartoonist and gradients though. / Yeah. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?460
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?461
That can't be the Pudding-Watcher. It's just a vague blob with eyes. / You doubt me? / You're just plain goofy-looking. / I am ORPUDDEX! / Sure you are. / If you were the Pudding-Watcher, you'd be fighting me as we speak. / FINE! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?461
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?462
I wonder how he'll get out of drawing the fight scene this time. / Like this. / Oh. / Maybe if we stop talking he'll have to draw it. / Oh, fine then. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?462
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?463
YAAAGH! / Ha! Tiny one. / Huh? / And now you are trapped. / Okay, this is just messed up and wrong. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?463
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?464
And now that I have ingested the Vegetable Sentry, I shall... / go... er... lie down... and try not to be sick... / Huh? / I coated the Sentry with expired margarine. Ancient battle recipe. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?464
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?465
So that's it? / Not quite. It was truly ancient margarine that I used. Even the dead must regurgitate when confronted by it. / Ah, here he comes now. / Floating on a wave of expelled pudding, the isosceles warrior returns from battle. / Towel. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?465
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?466
I apologize for having spoken against your skills. I have never met one as powerful with margarine as yourself. / Is the Watcher defeated so easily? / Only for the moment. When Orpuddex next strikes, he must be met with more force. / Why was he in such a pathetic form this time? / The cartoonist could draw no better. / Ah yes. I was going to ask about this "cartoonist". http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?466
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?467
Orpuddex is shrinking! / All the pudding he consumed from the earth's core... / being vomited out of him. / It's a Christmas miracle! / For once I'm glad the action isn't being drawn. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?467

Robert dreams.... / Beyond the Wiggly Lines of Sorrow, in the Cave of Eternal Caveyness, an electric peppermill / holds the key to what is to happen. Go alone, rhombus, for the triangle must train. / You're not really an ice cream man at all, are you. / Whatever gives you that idea? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?468
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?469
Triangle trains.... / With this magic, you will be able to rehydrate dried meats with almost no flavor loss. / No, I don't think so. / Hmm... how about a spell to heal damaged graham crackers? / Aren't there any USEFUL warrior-chef spells? / Mastery of cuisine magic is a task of great difficulty, and I'm not very good at it. / Most of my magic is microwave-only. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?469
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?470
Orpuddex rests.... / ... with Barbara Billingsley as June Cleaver! / Shh! Show's on. / Matthew Waterhouse as Adric! / Sorry. I just had to establish that you're still alive and not doing very much. / ...and Tom Baker as the Beaver. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?470
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?471
The Cornersheep plots.... / Shh. TV. / EX TER MIN ATE! / You're supposed to be plotting! / Newly recovered episode! / Now do you understand why you shouldn't tease the Daleks, Beaver? / Tape it! Plot now! / I'll plot when it's over. / Gee, I'm sorry, Mom. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?471
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?472
The Cornersheep plots.... / No. Still TV. / EX-TER-MIN-ATE THE BEA-VER! / Didn't it just end? / Multi-part story. Showing it all at once. / Mom! Dad! Get to the house and get out of here! It's only me they're after! / Complete sentences... / Out of the question. / Be careful, Beaver! They're pure evil! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?472
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?473
So it's a 1950's suburban American home that travels through time and space? / Right. / And the Beaver's an enigmatic man from another world who is, for some reason, older than his parents? / Right. / Have you even heard of a Jerry Mathers? / Yeah. He played the second Robin. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?473
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?474
You will not cross this path, rhombus. I, the Guardian of the Golden Way, will stop you! / That's okay. I wasn't going that way anyway. / Oh. / Well, good! Because if you were trying to go this way, I would stop you! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?474
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?475
Die, Polygon! / No, I'd rather not. / It wasn't a polite request. / Oh! I see. You're trying to kill me. / Toasty! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?475
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?476
Wow. Two monsters into your quest and you die. That's gotta be a record. / What? That's... that's pathetic! Triangle's supposed to have bad luck! I'm supposed to have good luck! / Luck doesn't enter into it when you stand that close to a dragon. / That was a dragon? / Apparently. It didn't look very fractal to me either, to be honest. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?476
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?477
That was totally unfair. There was no way for me to survive. / I didn't know it breathed fire. I thought it would just peck you or something. / You didn't KNOW? You drew it! How could you draw a fire-breathing monster and not know it breathes fire? / I'm not a very good cartoonist, okay? There. I said it. Are you happy? / No, I'm still dead. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?477
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?478
Triangle, you'll have to interrupt your training. I... um... Robert's dead. / Why don't you bring him back yourself? / I'm not sure if that would be artistically right. / Artistically right? When do you ever worry about that? / ......................... / Look, just point me to the Dragon Circles. Make it quick, I have a vorpal casserole in the oven. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?478
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?479
The first Dragon Circle is close by. I hope there isn't too big a monster guarding it. / I am Vokhloss, the Serpent of Many Colors. The Dragon Circle is Mine. / Serpent of... Many colors... / What? Is something funny? What's funny? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?479
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?480
Come on! What's funny? Tell me! / ...many colors... I'll tell you if you give me the Dragon Circle. / You drive a hard bargain, triangle, but my curiosity has the better of me. Take it. / There's a letter A on it. I think we all see where this is leading. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?480
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?421
If there really is an RDCLBA, then... then... / I get it! It wasn't enough for the ICI to discredit me.... They didn't want the RDCLBA to have any way to recruit me! / You see, this is why I don't like conspiracy plotlines. They just keep going on like this. / Never mind finding my file, we've got an Oval to catch! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?421
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?422
I'm still dead... so why am I in the strip again? Nothing's happened to me since last time. / I thought you might want a chance to look down and see what's happening. / Stuck for a strip idea again? / Uh... yeah... but that's none of your business! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?422
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?423
RDCLBA headquarters. The remaining agents have just become aware of the Oval's emergence from the depths. / That's my stapler! / I don't see your name on it. / It was on my desk! / They don't particularly care. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?423
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?424
The Fourth Race knew they weren't the first to inhabit the planet, but they thought they would be the last. Thinking their time as the dominant species would be forever, they made no efforts to leave a legacy. / All the prophecies we find were meant for their own kind, not for polygons. Our frame of reference is so different from theirs that we can't really know what they meant. / The Oval signifies something very big about to happen, something for which we should as a race prepare. Past that it's guesswork. / In other words, you don't know what's going on either. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?424

The recent tapioca shift took the Oval out of my reach, but no matter. I have grown. The puddings below are mine to command. / Arf! / Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip! / (My puddings now bubble to the surface.) http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?425

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?427
The lava's rising! I can't keep up! / Sticky, lukewarm... / Lava-flavored pudding! I was hoping someone would come out with this! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?427
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?428
Whee! / What's this, I leave town for a subplot and when I come back you've somehow flooded the town with pudding? / Lava-flavored pudding. / How'd your subplot go? / I left early. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?428
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?429
So you're saying this current disaster has nothing whatsoever to do with you? / To the best of my knowledge, yes. / Pudding doesn't come from volcanoes. / This pudding did. / Pudding can't erupt! It doesn't build up pressure like that. For there to be that much upward force, there'd have to be... uh... / Let's get to high ground. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?429
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?430
Help! I can't breathe pudding.... I can't even breathe parsley! / Parsley? Are you delirious? / No, it's a reference.... / A reference NO ONE will get. You must be delirious. / Do you even know what "delirious" means? / Yeah. It's like a squirrel. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?430
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?431
That bought us a little time, but what do we do? What's going on? / What's the ampersand doing there? / I decided to represent the title iconographically. / Do you even know what "iconographically" means? / Yeah.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?434
You cannot evade me! I AM the Pudding-Watcher! / Triangle! You need my aid. / Mr. Disease? Why would you want to help me? / Against the returned Pudding-Watcher, all of geometry is on the same side. / How can you help? / I forgot today's zany punchline. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?434

It smells all potatoey and carbonated here. Isn't there some other easily defensible structure we could hide in? / Triangle made an excellent decision. The Tater Fizz fortress will protect us well while we plan. / And the smell isn't THAT bad... remember Scotland? / Sheep, cologne, whatever. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?435
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?436
Now, If I'D been elected governor, I'd have built pudding shelters. We wouldn't have to hide in this bottling plant. / Robert, your "pudding shelters" were going to take in homeless pudding and help it find jobs. / Not just jobs, careers! / We wouldn't have to hide from this flood if all the pudding were off the street and in good homes. / I'll get back to you when that makes sense. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?436
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?437
We can't stay here forever. How can we stop the flood and drive off Orpuddex? / The flood will drain with time. / As for the Pudding-Watcher, ancient records tells of events such as this having happened before. The Pudding-Watcher must be driven off by a party of warrior-chefs, each a master of one food group. / There are three of us here. / Not us. The training would take far too long, even if we have the potential. I do not believe myself or the rhombus could ever attain true mastery. / So we have to do something annoyingly convoluted. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?437
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?438
Baa! / Sheep. / Your species already had its turn. / Baa? / Tell your master I am not to be commanded. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?438
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?439
Orpuddex just telekinetically forced a squadron of jetpacking sheep to crash-land. / The Cornersheep believes he can harness the element of pudding for his own purposes. / He is wrong, of course, but his efforts may distract the Watcher. In the meantime, we must locate the sentries of the four food groups and free them from whatever magic prevents their arrival. / Cube can help us begin. / Cube's dead. / Since when has that stopped anyone in this strip? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?439
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?440
To revive Cube, we must... / ask the cartoonist nicely? / That seems easier than my way. / No. I'm not copping out of this one. If you want Cube alive, you'll have to do it yourselves. / Then wishing on the Dragon Circles it is. / Sounds typically moronic. Let's do it. / No. I'm willing to parody anime in general, but an explicit Dragon Ball parody is just too pathetic. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?440
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?441
I'm not going to look for Dragon Circles. Just don't ask. Let's do something else. / The cube cannot be returned to life by any other means. / We could just hold a seance. We only need to ask a few questions, right? / But I want to do the anime thing! / I'm with Robert on this one. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?441
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?442
I hear a call.... HIM! Why would he expect my help? / Cube, if you can hear me, know that it is the Time of the Oval, just as you forewarned. We must put our differences aside. The four sentries must be awakened! / Do I throw rice now? / Seance, Robert, not wedding. We already went over this. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?442
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?443
You are correct. This is not the battle which Triangle shall fight. Awaken the four sentries from their magics so that the Watcher's power may be broken. / Four! Hear that, equilateral? Four sentries, four food groups. The Pyramid is a liar. / Shut up. / But it is true! The teachings of the Pyramid stand in conflict with the most ancient forces! / They are nonetheless sensible dietary guidelines for ages 6 and up. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?443
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?444
Travel first to Denmark, and there search Mount Probablyeruptsbeforethisplotlineisover. / The Vegetable Sentry meditates in a cave, heedless of the world. Find him and apprise him of the situation. You must gain his aid. / Shouldn't that be the "Fruits and Vegetables Sentry"? / Did you call me to argue ancient dietary philosophy or do you wish my guidance? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?444
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?445
How, then, does one get to Denmark when one is trapped in a bottling plant surrounded by pudding at least 180 pixels deep? / I will teach you a spell. / With this magic you will glide swanlike over pudding. / Have you ever seen a swan try to swim through pudding? / No, but I'm sure it's very graceful. / No, it's messy, slow, and ultimately fruitless. / Such are the ways of the cuisine-magic. / I just fashioned a crude sleigh by harnessing tapeworms to an inflatable armchair. Let's go! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?445
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?446
Ha! The Chosen One flees! / ...in the direction of... the airport... / Wow. Strong tapeworms. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?446
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?447
And thus it was that Triangle and Robert reached Denmark, and began the ascent of Mount Probablyeruptsbeforethisplotlineisover. / And it came to be that with much searching they came to a cave in which a strange polygon silently meditated. / He doesn't notice us. / Is he awake? / And I don't feel like drawing anything today. / Naturally. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?447
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?448
He doesn't seem to be asleep. It's like he's somewhere else entirely. / Can he hear us? / I don't see any reason why he wouldn't be able to. It seems like he just... doesn't care. We need to get his attention. / I'll give him a wedgie. / But... uh... he... / Good point. I'll give him pants, THEN give him a wedgie. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?448
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?449
No, this doesn't call for a wedgie. We obviously need some metaphysical psychological thingamajig to snap him out of it. / You mean like a toilet made of meatloaf? / Exactly. Only not a toilet, and not made of meatloaf. / I know just the thing. / You know how the cartoonist likes to complicate story arcs by referring back to really minor details that no one remembers? I bet the Vegetable Sentry's all sulky and detached because he was defeated by Mr. Disease's grandmother and her spatula! / And you get all this from a passing reference to Denmark in strip 346. Sounds about right. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?449
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?450
There was an old lady here, wasn't there? She challenged you to a duel, and you fought. / She beat you to within an inch of your life with her spatula, and you hid in this cave from embarassment. Well, that old lady's dead now, and you're still alive. It's time to get back to your life. Back to your duty as the Vegetable Sentry. / She's dead? How long has it been? / I don't know. Months, at least. / Oh. Why do they make alarm clocks so confusing? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?450
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?391
...but this might not be such a boring election after all. Wacky scheme consultant Robert Rhombus announced his independent candidacy today in a speech which left this reporter, frankly, rather startled. / Woof! Yip yip! Gubernatorial bow wow! Pant pant pant. Electoral growl growl! / I, for one, would like to meet this polygon's speechwriter. Back to you, Zoe. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?391
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?392
Ruff! / Yay! We're up in the polls again! / Bow wow wow. / But with my stated foreign policy position, wouldn't that be construed as flip-flopping? / Yip yip, woof. Growl: bark bark. / You're the best campaign manager ever! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?392
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?393
And furthermore, a gradual phaseout of the organ meat tax would reduce wear on our highways. / Is that right? I can't follow his logic. / He must be a genius! / So vote for me, and you won't have to wake up to sandwiches... anymore. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?393
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?394
Robert Rhombus has NO prior political experience. He has been BANNED from more than a few public / institutions for disruptive behavior. Will he suddenly become a responsible polygon if he becomes governor? / Heck, there's only one way to find out! Paid for by Citizens for Rhomboid Government. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?394
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?395
My opponent would have you believe I'm some sort of freak with no self-control or sense of dignity. Well, the fact of the matter is... / I'm running against a delusional moron. / Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clear this up. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?395
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?396
So this is death.... / Yup. / Wow. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?396
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?397
Outside ICI Global Headquarters / Austria / Late Morning / Triangle! It is a testament to your determination that you crossed the language barrier to come here. / Mr. Disease? You're in Austria? / You do not understand what it is you do. The voice of the Pyramid can shake the world, and perhaps the stars themselves. / It will come as no surprise to long-time readers of this strip that I have no idea what's going on. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?397
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?398
Do not disrupt the affairs of the International Culinary Institute. They do more good for the world than you may think. / What good does it do for an innocent polygon to be jailed? / You know so little. I had hoped it would not come to battle. / Battle? / Do you not realize that butterscotch would not be so sweet without tapioca on the other side to balance it? You will not enter this building. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?398
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?399
I regret that you did not accept my training. If you had, perhaps you would understand why you must not be here. / I understand justice. / Good comeback! / Thanks. / I will defeat you, however. / Look behind you! A three-headed confusing deus ex machina! / Nice try. / You think so? / Not really. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?399
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?400
Why haven't we started actually fighting yet? / I can't draw fighting. / Then... / Hold on. / This should work to move the plot along for now anyway, I can change it later if I need to. / Uh... okay... / Rock! / Paper! Now stand aside. / No. We shall make it two out of three. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?400
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?401
Rock! / Paper! / I am defeated. Triangle, I warn you, not for your sake, but for the sake of the world: cease your quest. What the Food Pyramid proposes is nothing less than oblivion. / Well, right. You can't have anything less than oblivion, can you. / I am defeated. You may pass if it is your will, but it would be better for you to heed my warning. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?401

Equilateral intruder on floor one, heading towards stairs. South security team, full alert. / Intruder is entering stairwell. Form blockades. / South squad G! Where are you?

You! / Y... you? / You've been following my trail. Don't deny it. Why? / Our trails sort of got crossed. I have to clear your name to clear mine. / I'll believe you, for now. Stay out of my way and watch the rear. / I'd ask what's going on but I'm afraid you'd tell me. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?403

Baa? Baa! Baa! / We've just hit a tapioca vein. There's no immediate danger. / Baa? / No. Keep digging. We're almost there. / Baa! Baa! / It's pudding. We'll be out of here before the site floods. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?404
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?405
The signal just peaked. We must be at the level of the relic. / Sonar doesn't work well through tapioca. We'll have to locate the relic through other means. / Here relic relic. Nice relic. C'mere. Good relic? I got a treat for you! Here relic relic relic! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?405
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?406
Baa! / I'll be right there. / The Oval? The relic is the Oval? / How? The Oval came from space, didn't it? What does it have to do with the Fourth Race? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?406
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?407
How could a relic of the Fourth Race have fallen from space? They were advanced, but hardly spacefaring. / This is the same Oval the the RDCLBA was after though.... / It will definitely be worth researching, assuming I don't almost immediately lose possession of it in some contrived fashion. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?407
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?408

We're not even scratching it! The Fourth Race built well. / Baaa! / This is a heavy pudding stratum! It shouldn't be able to flow that quickly! / Attention, all crew members. Cease operations and... evacuate. The tapioca won this round. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?409
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?410
It wasn't a total loss.... I now know that the Oval is connected with the Fourth Race... / and we met the secondary objective easily. / I now have more than enough boulders and butterflies to begin construction of my diamond machine. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?410
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?411
Yes? You in front. / Is it true you have ties with the RDCLBA? / No. That is not the case. I was running away from them for a while, but I run away from lots of government agencies. / Mr. Rhombus! What about the crossdressing? / I'm in the wacky scheme business. Of COURSE I end up in drag now and then! It's tradition! / Did you or did you not fail to prevent Maryland from being turned into a squirrel? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?411
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?412
It was fireproof when I got there! How was I supposed to know? Please. No more questions about number theory. / Next question.... You. / You claim to be against all forms of racism, and yet... / That storyline was non-canonical and you know it. Next question! / How do you plan to address the growing issue of non-Euclidean law enforcement? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?412
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?413
... listen, for the fourteenth time, I am aware that my actions were outside the bounds of law. The fact remains, however, that in Scotland it's not a felony. / Do you have any plans to deal with the rash of library vandalism? / Though the per capita rate is in fact still comparable to the national average, I will appoint a task force to investigate the issue. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?413
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?414
They asked a lot of personal questions, but I think I did pretty well. The question is, how much honesty does the public really want? / Growl woof yip yip. Bark bow wow. Pant pant bark, woof woof.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?416
Yeah! And we can repave key interstates with lime gelatin! The effect on tourism alone would be worth the stench! / Oh, and what if we turned a third of the courthouses upside-down every March?

Inside the Oval... / (It's Earth... but polygons? How did they get in charge? How long have I been gone?) / (They call mankind the "Fourth Race"... why? What happened to the world? And who's this "Cartoonist"?) / In order to reduce reader confusion, I'll state for the record that the Earth being referred to about which this strip concerns itself is not intended to be "our" Earth in any way. It evolved on a somewhat parallel course for reasons yet to be revealed. / What? What does that mean? WHO ARE YOU? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?417
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?418
Sir, my campaign manager ran away. Have you seen him? / Hey, you look familiar.... You're that meteor thing Cube and everyone was after, aren't you? / So, you haven't seen my campaign manager? It's an inverted capital G. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?418
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?419
The Oval! Was it taken? No... it is here under its own power. Fly away, little oblong of history. It is not safe here. / What? What does the ICI have to do with the Oval and the RDCLBA? / RDCLBA? No such agency. It's a myth. / No myth. They were after the Oval. Then they took a confusing detour to the Earth's core via Austria. / Uh-huh. Come on, the file room is this way. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?419
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?420
No, seriously. The RDCLBA is real. They were after me when I had the Oval. Then all the ones who were after the Oval died in a transporter accident. / You're just making this up, aren't you? / No. But the cartoonist probably was. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?420

THRILL as TRIANGLE CONTINUES TO DEDUCE! / Mr. Disease didn't sound desperate to be resurrected during the seance. Maybe he has something to accomplish in the vague comedy afterlife. / Then again, maybe he's being duped... or maybe we were being duped! What if that seance was intercepted, and instead of the afterlife we just contacted some abandoned warehouse or something? Is that possible? / Ergo, I must beat up phone company personnel. / What? / I don't have to do ALL my reasoning out loud. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2431

Hello! Please give me phone records before I kick you unconscious. / What records? / One cell, one fax.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2434
You got PHONE COMPANY RECORDS x 1 and 500 GP! / Why would phone company clerks be carrying so many gold coins? / Is that the thing that makes the least sense? / No, but it is something new the validity of which to question. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2434
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2435
According to this, the fax was coming from INSIDE THE HOUSE! Which is perfectly logical, since we called our own fax machine to relay the signal. / The ghostly cell phone... do the records list... Yes. This is interesting. The seance call is listed here, but I don't recognize the number for my end of it. I wonder what that number goes to, exactly. Not a phone, surely? / I said, "Not a phone, surely?" / Yes, I heard you. / Okay. If there was a needless stock punchline coming I wanted to be ready for it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2435

[[Triangle is using a cell phone]] / Hello? / [[Triangle shows motion but appears the same; the phone is now on its side]] / That panel didn't make any sense, did it? What happened was he fell over on his side. A bit hard to tell since he's equilateral, sorry. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2436

If our seance attempts keep getting fax machines, maybe the problem isn't on our end.

The fax is a picture of Mr. Disease's spirit trying to work the spirit of a fax machine. My mind balks at the implications of this message. / My mind also balks at the little blue crystals in cat litter and the countability of the rational numbers, so that's not necessarily a signifier. / Yes, I know there's a simple mapping to the integers.

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2408
Triangle, are you awake? / I'm fine now. / I found a new proof mapping the little blue crystals in cat litter to the prime numbers. / Either I was out longer than I thought and a significant amount of adventure happened without me or that is a complete non sequitur. / I forget which. / Just give me the fax. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2408
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2409
He's dead, he's trying to reach us, he doesn't have a voice line, and the ghost of a dead fax machine is too complicated for him to operate. / Does any of that make sense? / That would ultimately depend on what you mean by sense. But... no, it basically doesn't. / That makes it your job to solve. / We need an unconsecrated burial ground and a cell phone with big buttons. / Easy. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2409

One good thing about unconsecrated burial grounds: they usually don't have anyone to chase you away. / Yes. That was the easiest abuse of a graveyard we've ever committed.

Robert, stop fooling with the crystal ball. It contains no user-serviceable parts. / How can we know if we don't try? / It is in any event not in need of servicing.

Maybe the stars are just wrong, or something. These seance attempts just aren't working properly today. / The stars matter? / What? Sometimes, yes. / Beta Tapiocus is probably breaking astrology. / That's a good point. How can we compensate? / From what little I know of astrology, / I'll give you time to think about it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2416

Maybe we just shouldn't bother with a seance. We know he's dead and in the default afterlife, let's cut ahead to resurrection. / I was hoping to get a body. Non-body ones seem harder. / Then let's find it. We don't need a seance for that. / I have an idea. Let's visit the Locust Garden. / He once told us the spirit of his grandmother was in a statue there.

You are not to enter the kitchen. / Do you know who I am? / Yes, Triangle. Your assistance is not required. / Mr. Disease fell in battle. / Yes. Your assistance is not required. Please leave. / We were friends. I would like an explanation, at least. / Understandable. The best thing you can do is still to leave. / Out of respect for this restaurant, I will do so, but this is not over. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2418

The current restaurant manager is a warrior-chef in Mr. Disease's tradition. He doesn't want us to resurrect Mr. Disease. / Is the object of that sentence "us" or "to resurrect"? / You're being observant of details. Isn't that a bad thing for how you work? / I could have just been asking a random sentence-diagramming question. / No, it was pretty clear you were asking whether it was the resurrection or us doing it that was the issue. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2419

I need something to distract me. Important things are going on, and I can do the most good if I stay away from them and then re-enter the main plot at the last moment. / Usually you tag along and just ignore the important things going on around you. / I'm finding this part too important to ignore. / I might be growing up or something horribly inconvenient like that.

I'm not going to ask why half the shopping district is now twenty feet below the other half. I'm just glad you stopped whatever it was you were doing before magma got involved. / Or pudding, or whatever liquid stratum happened to be below that particular area. The point is, we don't have to worry about any further consequences from this. / I hope I didn't just set off a self-denying prophecy again. / I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

Whatever it is you hurt when you torture grammar, I think the right thing to do is stop. / I agree. / Unless we can be sure it's an animal, I'm not comfortable comically abusing it. / Your logic is grossly perverse. / But my syntax is okay, and that's the issue right now. / ! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2428

Restoring vintage pinball machines? Isn't that something that requires specific skills and practice? / I'm choosing to ignore that. / Waiting for Robert to randomly accidentally crack this restaurant mystery isn't enough.

I am honor-bound not to interfere with the Locust Garden itself, but I need to know what that new manager is up to. He's not just a random chef, he clearly trained with Mr. Disease and is aware of Mr. Disease's role as a Sentry. / Trained with a Sentry... wanting control over when and if that Sentry comes back from the dead... It could be a succession thing! If he wants to be the new Metamorphic Sentry, and thinks he's next in line... but each Sentry post is passed down differently. / Mr. Disease was the first Metamorphic Sentry, so what determines who's next? Perhaps he has to CHOOSE a successor from beyond the grave, and his spirit is being held captive until he does! I might be jumping to conclusions, but this seems far too plausible. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2430

...with notorious "protagonists" Robert and Triangle, who claim to possess the world's largest zucchini. / "Claim"? Look at the thing! / Given their tendency to perform various hoaxes on behalf of "wacky scheme" clients, the claim is of course questionable; however, I can say that it certainly looks like a very large zucchini. / Apparently there is a treasure connected to this zucchini in some fashion, but Triangle and Robert have refused to elaborate.

Wh...what did you just do to our zucchini? / Euthanized it. / There was no reason for what you did to that zucchini. The Book of Salads Past has already been reincarnated. / I am glad you're back and have no idea what you're talking about. Would you mind narrating a short flashback? / You weren't after the Book of Salads Past? / I don't even know what that is. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2373
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2374
If you weren't trying to recreate the Book of Salads Past, why were you growing a reincarnation zucchini? / Uh... Robert, do you want to field that one? / No! / Well, first of all, I have no clear notion of what you mean by a reincarnation zucchini. / We were growing a very large zucchini because we'd heard you were looking for a treasure hidden in the world's largest zucchini and wanted to attract your attention. / A hidden treasure? No. Not even close. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2374
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2375
I was part of the team growing the reincarnation zucchini for the Book of Salads Past. / I think I know what some words in that sentence mean. / The Book of Salads Past is a moderately ancient tome of recipes which hints at the Godfood of Vegetable. / Remind me what a Godfood is. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2375
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2376
Godfoods! Foods so powerful that their very recipes dimly possess universal consciousness! / Right! / Those. Like the Fondue and, apparently, the Starham. / Yes. The Book of Salads Past was destroyed in the recent past, but could be brought back into being within a reincarnation zucchini. / That being... a large squash that regrows a lost object inside of itself? / Yes. We had not considered that the zucchini would break a world's record and end up in a museum. / Hence stealing it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2376
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2377
I recovered the Book of Salads Past just before being captured by the... I never did get their name. / We're not sure about that either. So you escaped, and the other prisoners had heard you talking about the book and completely misinterpreted it, resulting in... Right. This entire situation now makes sense. / So what did you want me for? / Is it important? / At first we... myself, Robert, and the Meat and Grain Sentries... just wanted to make sure you were okay. But I think there is something important, yes. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2377
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2378
...something important, yes. If we don't destroy Beta Tapiocus, it will destroy us. / Survival of the polygon species and the possible alteration of cosmology itself... / I'll accept that that's worth having the Sentries team up, for the necessary duration. / I think I'm beginning to see why you didn't check in. / Your Fondue quest involved learning self-reliance? / Fondue quest? / The Fondue didn't give you a quest? / It sort of did, but nothing questworthy actually happened. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2378
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2379
Nothing questworthy happened? / No. Should it have? / Have you read about the Meat and Grain Sentries' quests? / Are they in the comic? No, I haven't. / I'd suggest doing so. / Will it take long? / No. It doesn't seem to consume any time at all. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2379
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2380
I'm back. / You didn't leave. / Spooky. / I think my Fondue quest, to the degree I had one, actually happened before everyone split up to handle their own quests. / And the climax was your realization that following the group was limiting your potential? / Precisely. For the sake of record-keeping I suppose I should flash back. / If you don't mind. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2380
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2381
After using the remainder of the Fondue to heal the sick, we set out towards the Farm the Dairy Sentry was now remembering as the site where he had learned its recipe. / The Dairy Sentry was remembering a lot of things, but they probably belong in his flashaback {{flashback}} and not mine. / So he will be able to give one? / I think so. / If he doesn't then the rest of us can fill in the gaps, but his story is his story. En route to the Dairy Sentry's old farm, we... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2381
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2382
If this is my flashback, where's the thing that wasn't broccoflower? / I'm trying to find a reasonable representative piece of clip art. I haven't had any luck yet. / "Trying to", progressive tense? I thought time didn't work like that between the strip and you. / Eh. It varies. / I should probably stop the flashback, then. I don't want space-time to get more ruined. / Never mind, got one. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2382
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2383
I cut and pasted it from a larger appropriate-looking image of a fractal. I think it's approximately what you were fighting? / That sticky-up bit on the right doesn't match, but it's pretty close to what I remember otherwise. / The actual fractal you were fighting kept shifting around anyway. This is close enough for a still. / What's with the color? / I know it was actually one color, but since no one can remember what color that was, I'll just vary it like an object in a dream, or something. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2383
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2384
As we approached the Dairy Sentry's farm, we were engaged in battle by a spawn of the ancient evil which had... / The reasons are more the Dairy Sentry's story than mine. I'll just talk about the battle itself. / I'll just reiterate that it was no broccoflower. The danger it posed was real and substantial. / Any reasons not to kill this thing? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2384
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2385
Any reasons not to kill this thing? / None. / Then let's. / My fight. Rest of you, stay back. / Stay what? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2385
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2386
I said stay back! My fight! / It's all our fight! / She was energized with potential gravy. He was going into some sort of biscuit-making maneuver. / That... uh... / Hurt. / We need to coordinate. / They need to calm down and let someone with tactics do it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2386
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2387
Can we stop arguing for one minute and just kill this fractal? / I have it under control! My fight! / It's growing! I think it's somehow feeding on us arguing! / Everyone shut up and attack! / No... I think we need to keep shouting and overfeed it. / I'm not so sure about that plan. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2387
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2388
I'm not sure I believe this story. I know the Sentries aren't a well-coordinated team, but arguing with each other in front of a thing trying to kill them? That sounds exaggerated. / So does killing every lightning god on the planet or jumping out of a plane from awkward embarrassment. / So this is another one of those "mythic" things. / Yes. Under non-mythic conditions, we'd probably have agreed on an attack plan instead of irritating each other. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2388
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2389
Keep arguing! If we argue enough, it'll explode! / Shut up! This is no time to be arguing! / You argued first, Linda. Just let me attack it alone! / You stink at attacking! / What part of this is my fight do you not understand? / The part where I don't get to kill anything. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2389
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2390
You don't have to kill everything. This is a dairy job. / Fine! Go ahead and lose! / I will! I mean... No! Yes! / It got bigger. / I told you that! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2390
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2391
I told you you'd lose. / ... / We've taken one fourth a rout and you're wasting time to insult our fallen member? If we're going to be a team we should act like one! / No, we need to - / This isn't some kind of puzzle we need to study to find the clever hidden solution! We need to hit this fractal, as hard as possible, as coordinatedly as possible! / That isn't a word. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2391
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2392
What? / "Coordinatedly." That isn't a word. / That moment was probably the turning point. There was no greater wisdom of the group to which I could defer. There really never was any. It had been wishful thinking. / Whatever I was going to do next, I would be the one to do it. I invoke... a border of lettuce... / Huh? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2392
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2393
I am in no condition to fight this thing, but at least I'm paying attention. / He sealed himself in with the monster. / No, he sealed us out. The border would only stop us, not him or it. / What's he trying to accomplish? / I didn't hear the Grain Sentry's reply to that. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2393
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2394
And then the fractal mauled you to death. / I'm standing right here. / That doesn't automatically mean you didn't die. / I didn't, though. I did get mauled a little, while I was getting my bearings, but then I hit back. / Any particular technique? / I mostly just stabbed it. It divided into smaller fractals as I hurt it, but its parts were uncoordinated and much weaker than the whole. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2394
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2395
He's winning. He's turning the fractal into cole slaw. / That's impossible. / Fractals aren't cabbages. He's just covering it with cole slaw to suffocate it. / What makes you think it breathes? / To crush it, then. Or bury it. He's using cole slaw as a weapon, not transforming the enemy into it. / Says you. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2395
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2396
"Says you"? That's real mature. / What do you know about slaw? / Can't you stop arguing for long enough to... No. You can't. We all saw different things in the Fondue, right? Maybe we're not supposed to be together. / Let's tend to the wounded then go our separate ways. There's no way it could be any worse than this debacle. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2396
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2397
You had a battle without me? I told you to call me back if anything attacked and you just let me scout? / The wound is minor, as is the condition of the Dairy Sentry. / Then I lost consciousness. I came to in a motel room; everyone had agreed to split up and done so while I was still unconscious. They left me with the room bill. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2397
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2398
Thank you. That flashback will certainly give us all something to think about. We can hope that the humility learned by the Meat and Grain Sentries will prevent something like that from recurring against Beta Tapiocus. / The Dairy Sentry couldn't beat one fractal, and that was just an offspring of the main one? / The Meat Sentry's interference kept him from using his full abilities. / I doubt he failed in his main battle. If he had, everyone would have noticed consequences. / We'll probably find out for sure soon. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2398
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2399
Do you think it'll work? / What? / Us against Beta Tapiocus. / Depends on the "us". / If that's the case then we've already mostly won. The whole point is for polygons to be the ones making their fate. / I'm not sure it's wise to be hammering that theme so bluntly. We need narrative uncertainty left for the climax. / You're right. If it's foreordained, we lose. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2399
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2400
I just realized horrible writing. / What? / We knew Mr. Disease before any of the other Sentries, and yet when we've / talked about the missing Sentries we haven't mentioned him. We should be more aware of his absence than any of the others. / Unless he's not really absent. / He's probably been with us in spirit the whole time, so we haven't thought of him as gone. / In spirit? / Yeah, he probably got killed and is haunting us. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2400
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2266
If not automata, what else might we be up against? / Other than the monster itself? Guards. Probably with ray guns. / I suppose there's no armor around. / Maybe if I just wait it out they'll come and get me. I'm not completely expendable. / Wait. Idea. / I can use you as a hostage! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2266
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2267
Hostage, gun, vague idea of where I need to go, keys. Time to blow up the lockdown barrier and see what tries to kill me. / Boom! / Nothing but a few automatic turrets.

<<*tappity tappity tappity*>> / Turrets disengaged? I was just pressing random keys to warm up, I hadn't even started actually trying to do anything. I guess they figured anyone at the control terminal would probably not want to be shot at by default. / I've made it this far without even needing my hostage. They're probably enforcing the lockdown at the exits instead of spreading their forces inside. / I have no idea what I'm going to be up against.

Guardroom. Abandoned hastily. There are monitors, but it looks like they're just for this area. I can't see what'll be waiting outside. / Are there tapes? Yes.

No hints about what's waiting at the exit, I suppose? / Correct. / I'm guessing that if I ascend the stairwell I'll only be able to go up a few floors at a time before encountering some sort of obstacle which diverts me around the base to another stairwell. / Ah. You noticed the video gameness of the setting. / At some point I'm bound to end up fighting escaping experiments of geometry gone mad, collecting ammo from dead guards.

This elevator feels familiar. Tetris! The elevator is either from Tetris or copied from Tetrean technology. Now how can I use that to make it go? / Cartoonist!

As I understand it, the Fourth Race programmed their geometic creations to obey the same laws of gravitation obeyed by matter. / If that programming is the only reason a Fourth Race elevator knows up from down, then reversing the buttons just might get it to fall in the opposite direction, when the cable is cut. / I'll have to slow the descent, ascent, whatever, so it's safe.

We heard about groups of polygons fighting each other outside this fake "warehouse" and we stepped in to stop them. / We? / The Grain Sentry and myself. Triangle said it wasn't his story arc to deal with. We soon realized that escaped test subjects were fighting guards and scientists. / The police are taking everyone into custody as they leave.

We talked to some of the less insane test subjects. Only the ones in prime numbered pens were freed, and a few in large multiples of seven. / They also described the thing that freed them. / I guess it's not good at factoring sevens. But what about the Vegetable Sentry? / He was being held in a level below where the breakouts started, according to some of the escapees.

We're waiting for the flow of escapees to slow down before we go in. The more information we can get first, the better. / I don't have much to tell you.

My cuisine-magic is starting to weaken. I think I have less endurance now that I'm dual-classed. / Dual-classed? / I'm both a Meat Sentry and a Valkyrie. The steed, remember? / I know that. You just used a weird word for it. / I guess I did. Anyway, we need to hit a commissary or at least a vending machine. I need pork or turkey. / I'm low on sesame.

Ja, it be many a long year since last we flew ye skies. 'Twas a long time ago indeed ze curse befell us. / Achtung! Ve need more grog! / Belay that, I be ye cap'n and I be sayin' when the grog be needed, dummkopf! I be considerin' me log.

Shut up about ze grog or ve'll keelhaul dich! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2362

The chest, she was as magical as ve'd been told, but zat magic came unexpected. Aye, 'twas a shock to find our very ship becomin' smaller an' smaller, an' us on it too. / Then into the briny deep the wily wizard threw the chest, after it'd swallowed us up mit is strange shrinking magic. And so beneath the seas ve slumbered f?r years and years, until a treasure-seeker braved the waters and hauled us out as his catch. / An' when that chest were opened, out came our ship, good as the day she was made, and off we flew, to continue our piratin' ways, however distant a future this may be. / I be done talkin' now, break open ye grog. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2363

That's right. I think I remember now. Who'd expect a treasure chest to be filled with tiny pirates? / And then I ended up on top of the expanding zeppelin and fell off.

Yes, I'm fine now. I think we've lost the trail of the world's largest zucchini, though. / Why were we looking for that? / Because the Vegetable Sentry mentioned it before disappearing. You know that. / So we just assumed that he'd also be looking for it and we'd cross paths. / For lack of a single even remotely better idea! What else can we try? / Growing our own. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2365
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2366
If the world's largest zucchini has a treasure in it, growing a zucchini ourselves will not... / We publicize it. / We show a large zucchini. We claim it is the world's largest. We wait for treasure hunters. / And then maybe they'll know what the treasure is! / That sounds like the sort of plan that backfires horribly in an Umberto Eco novel, illustrating that employing untruth in the search for truth is inherently self-defeating. / Umberto what? / I think it's a fish or something, from a Sega game. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2366

Robert? You're still here? What kind of tranquilizers do they have you on? / I've been thinking. / Ah.

Later, at the Greenhouse of Mystery: / Now THAT's growing a zucch- what did that caption say? / "Later at the Greenhouse of Mystery:". / I didn't ask for mystery. I asked for a greenhouse. / It's just a name. / Why is it named that? / It's eponymous. We're renting it from Zachariah Mystery. / And this raised no questions in your mind at all. / Well, I wondered how to spell "Zachariah". My. That is quite a zucchini there. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2368
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2369
How sure are you the growth ray won't wear off or make it explode or anything silly like that? / I am fully confident that, if anything silly happens because of the growth ray, it will be far silier than that. / Silly like giant quasi-intelligent zucchini claiming a destiny to succeed polygons as the dominant lifeform? / That's not silly at all, in context. / Whenever I try to think about how silly our context is I feel a great, / almost inexplicable sadness. / Did you just pronounce a line break? / I don't think so, no. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2369
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2370
The botanists and notaries are going to be here in a couple hours to confirm the largestness of the zucchini. Is the zucchini still safe? / Hmm... that's odd... / What's odd? Is the zucchini doing something odd? Are we doomed yet? / Heh. "Are we doomed yet?" That should be a catchphrase. / Robert! What's odd? / The zucchini is still fine and there are no discernable side effects from the growth process. / Oh. Yeah. That's pretty odd. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2370

Now put it back in the artifact room and reseal everything. / I don't know how to put the alarm system back together. / The alarm system is mostly to keep you out personally.

I guess we should call Cube and let him know it's safe to come over. / Why? / So he can... / / I'm going back to bed. If Cube wants our help he can pay the standard... no, the hazard rate. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2239
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2240
Having left Triangle and Robert to deal with their own problem, Cube seeks a safe place to begin his experiment. / I obviously can't do this in public, but it has to be outdoors so I can follow the signal. Where could I set up a bunch of geometry supplies and not get arrested? / I wonder if that thing Triangle and Robert do where they wander around aimlessly until plot happens would work for me. It's worth a try. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2240
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2241
I'm doing something wrong. By the third panel of aimless wandering the plot should have gone somewhere. / Maybe if I wear a silly hat... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2241
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2242
Either this hat isn't silly enough or this sort of thing only works for the main characters. I'd guess it's a main-character thing and not a hat-silliness thing. That means I need to apply actual thought. / Large open area, unpoliced, where I'll go unnoticed while setting up disgusting geometry equipment. Oh. Obvious answer. Use the enemy's secrecy against them. Do it on the ruins of their abandoned research base. No one should be able to see in. / I should probably use a biohazard suit anyway, so the potential decaying filth problem won't be a big deal. I think this is an actual plan. An unsavory plan, but I've done worse. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2242
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2243
Barren? No food waste? No trash? No abandoned barbecue pits? Someone's been here. Someone was either looking for something or trying to ensure no one else would find it. / I'll assume for now that they did their job right and there's nothing for me to find here. I really do not look forward to doing this. / Note for human readers: Geometry supplies, while nearly essential to polygon reproduction, are generally considered highly embarrassing. / Right, so can I do this experiment in private? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2243
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2244
This panel denotes the passage of time, clumsily. / Is it okay to put you back in the strip now, Cube? / What do you think? / I think you're in some sort of underground prison. / And? / And I'm grossly overusing in medias res? / Correct. / I suppose you can't start writing this comic over and come in earlier, before the whole ambush? / I'd rather not raise that question. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2244
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2245
Do you have an escape plan yet? / Shouldn't I recap how I got here first? / Your call. / I'm working on sort of a plan, but it'll be more likely to work if I don't say anything about it out loud until I spring it. I might as well collect my thoughts in flashback form. / I set up the... equipment and started it. Before I could make sense of the results, they'd detected what I was up to. I should have realized they'd locate me as quickly as I could locate them. I also should have expected them to have teleportation. I made a lot of that sort of mistake, all in all. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2245
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2246
I'm not sure if they were shooting to kill or not, but when I took cover they switched to gas grenades. I didn't totally lose consciousness. / They didn't use the teleporter on the way back. I'm not sure exactly where this dungeon is, but I do know the general area. / Why didn't they teleport back? / How would I know? / You know a fair amount about teleport tech. You don't have a theory? / Of course not. It's not like that would be integral to the escape plan I'm forming, now would it? / Uh. . . yes. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2246
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2247
So, what do you know about your captors? / It's definitely the shadow agency that replaced the RDCLBA. They're not just about covering up Fourth Race technology, though. They're trying to exploit it. / You've tried to do that yourself. / Yes, and I've worked alongside an acknowledged supervillain to do it. But I published my results. Well, most of them... / I was writing them all UP for publication, honest. I just hit a couple roadblocks. Also, I never attempted any inhumane experiments on the very building blocks of our species. These guys are, I'm pretty sure. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2247
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2248
They're definitely experimenting with the very building blocks of our species. It's whether the experiments are inhumane that I'm not entirely certain about, but there's strong reason to believe they are. / Such as? / I saw a pile of line segments, twitching. They might not have been torn from the living, but they smelled of death. I saw a... a mass of white pixels. I couldn't even understand what it was exactly, but it seemed like it was trying to speak. Or scream. / There's worse than that going on, behind massive steel doors with defenses scarier than anything I can remember. I heard bits of conversation.... Anyway, they chucked me in this cell. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2248
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2249
To all those who create, there looms the specter of incompetence. To those who seek to create life, that specter may, itself, live. Thus it is that Prozac the Bear enters our story. / Hi! / The reification of my own incompetence, he can also serve as that of others', when those others seek to create with forces beyond their ken. / And their Barbie and Skipper! / Ah, if only they were content to play thus with dolls. / Do I have to have any idea what you're talking about? / You don't have to have the idea. You are the idea. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2249
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2250
Even the ones that move fall apart. I don't think we're looking at enough parameters. There's some additional input we need to provide for the geometry to be self-sustaining indefinitely. / Had I mentioned to you I was thinking there might be more of a temporal component involved? / That's right. That periodic... what did you call it? / "Heartbeat function". / How long would it take you to set up some sort of test? / I think we can do it manually next run, just to get an approximation. / Let's do it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2250
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2251
*doop* / What was that? / Second pulse in two... one... / *BOOP* / Repeating first in two... one... / *doop* / Someone is making a horrible mistake right now, aren't they? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2251
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2252
*BOOP* / The pulses are having an effect! / It looks like the short edges are buckling outward and curving. / *doop* / Medial line? Should we keep going? Now that we know the function works, maybe we should try to tune it. / *BOOP* / That has to be coming from the lab on this level. I'm thinking I should be looking even harder for an escape opportunity now. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2252
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2253
Well? / Gut instinct. / I hear someone coming closer to this cell. / Sure, it might be enough data. / I've just never seen you freeze up in the middle of an experiment. / Something just felt wrong about the curves. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'll be more comfortable if we check everything over. / (Scientists. Not guards.) http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2253
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2254
Hey out there! Can you here me? / What was that? / Research subject. Don't listen. / (Sounds like one's new.) / I'm a scientist too! My name's Cube! You're probably read parts of my Fourth Race research! / He's lying, right? / It doesn't matter either way. / What do you mean? / You don't interact with subjects. It invalidates the data. / Subjects? I'm more valuable to you for my knowledge! You should be interrogating me! / (They've already left.) http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2254
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2255
Not a polygon, then. You were right to stop the experiment. / It was going to be some sort of lifeform, though, and it seems a lot more stable than the last few. / Are you saying we should continue the run? / Not tonight. If it's not a polygon it might not be bound by polygon limitations. We need to reinforce the containment in case it's some sort of monster. / The containment's built to withstand anything up to and including a Sentry attack. Unless you have some other objection, automate the pulses for an overnight run. / No really coherent objections, no. I'll start coding. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2255
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2256
Sometime after midnight: / Soemthing woke me up. Is someone out there? / Quiet. / Something horrible has happened. I don't know if you're really Cube... I probably shouldn't be doing this. There's an automatic lockdown going on to keep it from escaping... it already did... I'm scared. / What escaped? / I don't know. We were bringing an artificial rectangle to life and it went oblong on us. It looked like it might somehow be... I don't want to say. / Let me guess. Lockdown protocol makes no provision for the safety of survivors? / Exactly. We both need to escape from here now. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2256
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2257
If you can't actually open the cell then what was the point of coming over here? / If you're really Cube, shouldn't you already have an escape plan? / I was working on one, but it involved a guard opening the cell door before I pulled anything. Can't you science the door open with chemicals or something? / We don't have chemicals. / Let me backtrack there. We don't have science chemicals. There are munitions. You'll have to tell me how to use them. / Make a list. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2257
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2258
You'll want to keep unrolling the fuse now. Get it out to its full length. / [[Cube waits]] / Good, good, keep going... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2258
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2259
Cube, I presume. / I want to make one thing clear: not only don't I trust you, I also don't trust the situation. / This whole thing could be staged to manipulate me, either with or without your awareness of that fact. / That does sound like something Cube would have written. / I guess you'll want to scout around now. The lab where... the lab is down on the right, the open door. Stay 300 pixels away from the lockdown barriers unless you want to get shot at. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2259
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2260
I have no idea what happened here, but I'm disgusted by it. They made a monster? It broke things? / Things that... / Maybe I should be looking for escape routes, not thinking about what this stuff was for. / That hole... I'm going to very carefully stand so that there's no way the hole and I can both be on-panel, because if it's what it looks like the safest panel to be in doesn't include it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2260
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2261
The hole, in the lab... / We can't get out that way. If it leads anywhere it's to more defenses. / I didn't think we could. The hole, though. It's shaped like / That's why I wanted you to see for yourself. It's not something to mention out loud. / But why would... the hole was left by something going OUT. What exactly did you do? I think I need to know before we can continue. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2261
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2262
I'll tell you, but keep one thing in mind: I know my way around more than you. Your chances of escaping go down without me. / We were trying to create new polygonal life, using harvested raw materials. Nothing we brought to life stayed alive for more than a few minutes, until I added a new parameter. What started as a rectangle curved. / A rectangle... BECAME that? / Yes. We assembled it from parts. We didn't know what it would do, but we thought it was safely confined, until after it changed. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2262
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2263
So it's a newly created entity. / If you insist on applying logic, but I don't think this is a logical situation. I think it's the real thing. / Where did it go? If it went in a straight line after making that hole, what would its destination be? / It would pass through a guard station, then a hallway, then I think through a subject pen. / Past there... bathrooms, janitorial, then solid rock. / No clues there. Maybe predicting its moves is a waste of time. We just need to get out of here. Do you know of any teleport systems nearby? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2263
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2264
I don't think there are any teleporters in the complex. They throw off the experiments. / How far underground are we? / Something like three hundred meters. / How many entrances are there? / I wasn't cleared for that. I only know two. / What kind of scientist are you? You're not cleared for something, so you actually don't try to learn it? Where's your insatiable curiosity? / I'm not sure, and I don't feel like looking for it. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2264
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2265
We can blast through one lockdown barrier. What'll be waiting on the other side? / That depends. Maybe nothing but carnage. / Some philosopher automata from Tetris got repurposed. They might have been dispatched here. If so, I doubt there'd be any other guards. / What other possibilities? No. Wait. / Repurposed? How did you manage that? / I don't know the details. There are a lot of different research teams down here, and they don't all intercommunicate. / Pity. I almost had a plan. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2265
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?241
The most startling of my discoveries is that the Fourth Race were not polygons. / Polygons are not the first civilized species on this world, and from the name the Fourth Race gave themselves we can surmise that they were not the first either. / What name was that? / The Fourth Race. What, you think archaeologists would come up with a cool-sounding name like that themselves? / Oh good, a joke, of sorts. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?241
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?242
This plot is really dull. Can we go on a tangent? / Sure. / Uh oh, Robert, you said... / Ow! Gratuitous geometry pun! / And we're actually on a secant. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?242
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?243
And so, secretly sent to destroy the artifacts secreted within this temple, I instead seek to secretly learn from there secrets. / Now draw some templey stuff so I can get on with it. / I suppose stairs are a start. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?243

You don't actually know anything about archaeology, do you? / No. / So long as you're drawing the expedition I'm not going to be able to make any important discoveries. / No, only plot-advancing ones. / So why don't you do some other plotline for a bit and let me do the archaeology. / Sounds good to me. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?246

http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?260
I don't think I can pull this off. / WHO SPEAKS OF WHAT? / Huh? / I had this whole story arc thing planned out, but I don't think I can do it and still be funny. / So we're going to abandon another potentially-gripping plotline to its fate? / Yeah. Business as usual. / How do you live with yourself? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?260
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?261
So you're backing out of the whole Oval plotline? / Yup. Can I borrow your teleporter? / Sure. / And so another third panel dies, jokeless, alone, and unloved. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?261
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?262
By the way, did you know that cursed relic thing was never destroyed? / What Then that means... / that means Triangle and Robert are a pair of incompetent nincompoops who can't possibly be trusted with the Oval! / Yup. You'll have to go take it from them. Use this teleporter. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?262
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?263
Hey Orpuddex, Cube's headed towards the oval. / WHAT? / I must stop him! For the sake of the universe, whicch I sort of want destroyed anyway but would buch rather destroy for myself, he must be stopped! / Then you should stop soliloquizing and start chasing him. / Good point. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?263
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?264
RDCLBA Industries, how may I direct your call? / I know what this place really is and I need to talk to the Pentagon. / Yes, this is the Pentagon. What is it? / It's about one of your agents. Cube. / That backstabber! Tell me where he is! Now! / That's exactly the reason I called.... http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?264
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?265
Triangle! For the sake of the world, hand over the Oval! / I don't have hands. / Okay, then, um... vertex it over! / Sure. Here you go. What is this thing anyway? / No time to explain. I think the agency's after me. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?265
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?266
Chosen One! For the sake of the multiverse, hand over the Oval! / Uh... Cube has it. / That cube has been a thorn in my side for too long. This time he dies. / Yeah, right, sure. / I have no time to listen to sarcastic taunts. The cube dies! / Okay. Go on then. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?266
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?267
Citizen! For the sake of the nation, hand over the Oval! / You're too late. / Cube has it, and he's already on his way to, uh, do whatever it is you don't, uh, want done with it. / He... wouldn't... DARE! / Wouldn't dare to do what, exactly? / If you don't know I'm not going to tell you. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?267
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?268
Orpuddex on the left... the RDCLBA on the right... no other directions to move in because I can't fly or dig and there's no working third dimension.... / This thing better work. / Huh? Where'd Cube, Orpuddex, and those government agents go? / Austria, if I set the teleporter right. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?268
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?269
Here's your teleporter back. / Thanks. What did you need it for anyway? / Well as I said, I needed to back out of the Oval plotline because I had an elaborate story arc planned and forgot to put any jokes in it. / And the teleporter? / I got all the problematic plot elements in one place and got Cube to use the teleporter. The whole story arc's cooling its heels in Austria now. / Subtle. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?269
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?270
Uh, did you say Austria? / Yes, I said Austria. / The teleporter doesn't go to Austria. / I thought it had enough power to go anywhere in the world. / The problem's not the power supply. It's the language barrier. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?270
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1
You call THIS a comic strip? / What are we supposed to BE? / I mean, honestly, if you can't draw, you have no business trying to write a comic strip. / I don't even have EYES! / Shut up or you're both going in the screen saver. / At least we'd be colored IN there! / Is this strip over yet? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?1
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?e1
Triangle. Triangle! / Another hiatus. Time is definitely failing. / I guess we did have a hiatus, but that's not / Oh... / The borders. We're in some sort of panel grid. / We are? Interesting. Minor, but it might be a clue. / You didn't even notice the grid? What are you talking about, then? / I can't believe you don't feel it! / You sound serious. / The Cartoonist, Triangle! / What about him? / His presence. You don't feel... / He's here, yeah. What about him? / I don't understand? How can't... / Robert, your connection to me is unique. Triangle really doesn't feel what you do. / What happened, Cartoonist? / I think I could use some exposition right about now. / I'm not completely sure what it is myself, but it's something metaphysical. / The Cartoonist always felt like an outsider, separate from our universe but impinging on it. / "Felt"? / Yes, past tense. Something very large has changed. The 12-panel grid might be a symptom, but it's something much bigger. / You're saying the fundamental meta-universal and meta-narrative nature of the Cartoonist... / It's gone. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?e1
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2
For Polyhedron's sake, either draw us right or let us out of this strip! / Who's Polyhedron? / What? I don't know. It must be some stupid expression the author came up with. / Well, rotate my vertices and call me a trapezoid! / HEEELLLP! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?2
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?e2
Robert, stop scaring me. / I'm scared too. Cartoonist, what HAPPENED? / I don't know, exactly. I'm a character in this strip, not the author. / Huh? / Then who's the author? / Until that last hiatus, I was identical with the author. I haven't always synced up in every fact, but my identity and my emotional state were his in a thematically meaningful way. / And now you've changed. / No, he did. I'm a fundamentally static character. / So you're... / The Cartoonist. My characterization as that being stands. I'm just no longer the actual being creating the comic. / I was hoping this would happen. I wrote a plotline contingent on it. I have no way of knowing if that plotline is still going to be carried out, but it would be a good one. / I think we need more exposition. What exactly changed? / I don't know. I'm not privy to the thoughts of the writer. I remember things up to the change, and I can deduce from my own existence that he continues to exist. / Has there been a change of authorship? / I don't believe so. I wasn't planning one, anyway. As far as I know, the writer now is the same person I was. He just outgrew the persona he wrote himself as. / What kind of change was it? / I don't think he can answer that, Triangle. We should focus on the plotline. / It was some action, sustained thought, or experience I could never have, in my own mindset. / I remember everything from when I was identical with the writer. Well, not everything, human memory is tricky. I remember as much as he would. / And you had a plotline in mind for when this happened. / A pretty good one, I think. / Here's the key to it: You weren't real to me before. I had no ethical obligations towards you, only artistic ones. / I did horrible things, and while they were morally permitted when I did them, they no longer are for my current existence. I need to make reparations. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?e2
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?3
Just us, here, alone. No background, no props, no other characters... / I'm hungry / Not only didn't you give us any food, you didn't even put in the ten seconds' worth of effort it would take to give us mouths! / I think I also need to go to the bathroom. / OK, I guess I really should give you food. Here. / And how are we supposed to eat it? / I think I'm allergic to chocolate. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?3
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?e3
You were just writing a comic strip, Cartoonist, You have nothing to atone. / Maybe not to atone, but I do have an obligation to help my fellow beings, and that means fixing things where possible. / I can't wave a deus ex machina and make everything better. I'm still bound by the characterization I'm written to, and that includes the attempt at making a meaningful narrative. / And incompetence at same. / Yes. / I can't be the one who writes what's going to come, you see. If I did somehow manage to get it right, I'd just go on to undermine it somehow. / This universe... I don't know what it was like before I came, but I'm sure it was better than I wrote it. / You believe it had a before? / Yes, it's written to have had one. Why wouldn't I? / Just the comic's own state, the lack of visual quality... that was already an unforgivable crime against your reality. / That's before getting into the actual content of the strip. For no particular reason, I've had you two, and others, lay so much waste. I never even bothered drawing the waste you laid. / And above all the individual crises and disasters and pointless body count raising, there's the cycle of Races, the wiping out and the restarting of life on this world. It's the Beforings' fault within the narrative, but I did write it into being. / But you're going to fix it alluntil you can hear Prozac. / I'm not a wacky rhombus. No wandering. I'm going to set out in a methodical fashion and make a map. / I bet you loved the first two Bard's Tale games. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?643
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?644
Hey! It's Prozac the Bear! / He must be here to rescue us! / Yeah! Or... maybe... to... perform... a really terrible juggling act. / Insanely bad. / I hope that cheered you up! Bye bye, happy people! / Should we... / I don't think he'd hear us. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?644
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?645
Can anyone hear us? / Help! / I can hear you! I'll be right there! / See? The map helped! / Fine. / Can you hear me in there? How can I get you out? / Not by juggling. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?645
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?646
When do the automata patrol by here? Is there a regular pattern? / Automata? / The pointy things. / Why do you call them automata? / He must know something we don't. / Yes, well... yes. That peppermill I was playing with drew the attention of Tetris's defenses. The actual inhabitants of the city are long since dead, but their servants continue to perform their functions. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?646
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?647
It all goes back to the Fourth Race. Some of you might have read about my research and its conclusions. / It's hard to believe, but I believe it. If the Cartoonist is possible, anything is. / Well then, you know that the Fourth Race weren't polygons. That peppermill I had on the plane was a relic of theirs. / The Fourth Race had condiment technology? That's... that's... / That's a very minor detail. Actually, the Fourth Race's cuisine contains many strange parallels to our own. I now know why that is, but let me get back to the peppermill first. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?647
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?648
Uh oh. What does the shading mean? / I've deactivated the automata for a bit so you can finish the peppermill exposition. / And then what? / You should be able to escape without any additional help. Just tell the story. / Hmm... no. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?648
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?649
Last time I advanced the plot for you, I ended up dead. Right now, I'm the only one who gets the whole point of the peppermill. / That means you'll keep me alive. If I give the exposition you want me to give, I'm useless to you. / It's not like I killed you on purpose! / That doesn't make me any more confident. You're dangerous, and I'm holding on to the one card I have. / That isn't a punchline. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?649
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?650
I guess I have to negotiate. / Don't bother. I don't need anything from you. / Only the automata can open the confinement square, and they're deactivated until I say otherwise. / I don't need to open the square to free the passengers. / Oh. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?650
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?651
Robert, jiggle the running light controls a little to get the turn signal to turn off. / Aye-aye. / Cube'll be fine, I think. / Aye-aye! / Aye-aye? / Small primitive nocturnal forest-dwelling primate of northern Madagascar that has a round head, large eyes and ears, and long thin fingers! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?651
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?652
You were right. Cube can take care of himself. By now he's probably freed everyone and is working on fixing the Tetrean teleportation pad. / Does that mean the plot's going back to me now? / Yeah. Mr Disease should be conscious soon. / What about the peppermill? / Cube will eventually publish his research. I'll just have to wait until then. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?652
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?653
He's coming around folks! He'll be okay and ready to / ... / ... / Oh no, he thinks he's Duke Togo! / I have no idea why I just said that. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?653
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?654
How... how long has it been? Have the other Sentries been found? / Not long. No. / Nnnn.... news! I need... ...news! / I'll go get some papers and the past strips. / Hurry back. I may need wiping. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?654
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?655
Do not forget, Orpuddex knows much and reveals little. Chance brought him to Tetris, but he has plans. / I can provide my OWN mood narration, thank you very much. / You have your job, I have mine. / Having slipped out of the group confinement square well before Cube's rescue of the passengers, Orpuddex slides unnoticed through the rooms of the underwater city. / Are you done now? / I think so. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?655
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?656
I swiftly make my way to the central control system of the vast geopudding pumps which still power the forgotten metropolis of Tetris. / But upon reaching the main console, Orpuddex is dismayed. / No. ME. MY narration. You just draw. / If there's narration to be done, I'm doing it. / You allowed the cube to narrate! / That was recapping and exposition. I reserve narration for myself. / Such selfishness is unbecoming. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?656
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?657
Orpuddex and I have reached a compromise. He'll recap what he did in Tetris when he's done, and until then I'll point the strip at something else. Um.... / Let's check on what the Food Pyramid is doing! / ... a few satchel charges here.... / timer to 12 minutes... there we go. Not even Trapezoidal Agent 59 is going to be able to stop these babies from going off. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?657
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?658
... so the RDCLBA sent the new guy. I've been hoping to check out this "Pyramid"... / What was that?... The roof! I heard you up there... 59 I presume? It doesn't matter. This tomb is getting sealed no matter what the ICI wants. / So I was expected. That should make this more interesting. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?658
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?659
Come back and fight! / No. You can't defuse all the charges in ten minutes. / I'll stay at a safe distance and watch. I'd advise you for your own sake to do the same. / Thank goodness. I was worried I'd cornered myself into a fight scene. / (The Cartoonist? Here?) What are you doing here? This isn't one of your plots! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?659
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?660
What am I doing here? I'm saving your scrawny apex, that's what. / How? / Um... actually I didn't mean to type that. I'm here because you'll be back in the main story soon. / Which branch? / Most of them. I think you're next in line to touch what's left of the Starham. / Would letting me know what the Starham will do in advance be totally out of the question? / ... / Just wondering. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?660
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?661
Pyramid to command. The tomb is sealed. 59 was present. I did not engage. / We read. / The Cartoonist has contacted me. / Has he asked for anything? / No. He has indicated that I will have access to the Starham leftover artifact. / That sounds good. If you get a chance at that bone, destroy it and bring any debris here for analysis if possible. Analysis is secondary, repeat secondary. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?661
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?662
Hey! Let go of that! I was studying it! It's gonna be in the next plotline! I need to know how to work it! / Grrrrrrr. / Give... it... here! / Grr. Grr, grrrr. / I think something just happened. / . http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?662
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?663
Hi. I'm back. Uh, you do know the Starbone's on the ceiling glowing, right? / It just got up there a few minutes ago. I'm waiting to see what it'll do next. / Where's the inverted capital G? / I think it went upstairs. It's probably figuring the bone'll float up through the floor. / I already mentioned I'm back, right? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?663
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?664
Before, when the G was gnawing on the bone and changing shape... do you think that last transformation was for real? / When it was a polygon? I didn't think so... but if we're talking about it now, this long after the fact, it must be relevant to the plot, so probably yes. / That's the sort of reasoning I'd use. / You're right more often than I care to admit. / Woo-hoo! I'm the rhombus! I'm the rhombus! http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?664
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?665
Pyramid to command. I am in front of Triangle and Robert's home. If I read the comic correctly, this is where to find the bone. / We read. Maintain radio silence. / (Radio silence?) / That was your eighteenth report. I think they just don't want to have to listen to you. / What? / You keep checking in over and over. I know you've been a fugitive for a while and you want to earn their trust, but cool it. The RDCLBA doesn't need to hear about every step you take. / Ohhh... I get it. You're trying to get me in trouble. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?665
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?666
Pyramid to command! Mr. Disease is approaching the Triangle and Robert home. / Pyramid! Radio silence! Do not report until your mission is complete. / Hmm... does Mr. Disease have a radio scanner? / I told you. They just don't want to hear you. / Excuse me? Sir? Are you the Food Pyramid? / What's it to you? / If you are, I owe you an apology. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?666
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?667
Mr. Disease is outside talking to someone. I can't see who. / He's out of the hospital already? That's good. / The bone's still on the ceiling. / Use your special technique for clean-up of leftovers, Triangle! / I don't have a special technique for clean-up of leftovers. / You should learn one. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?667
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?668
... and so, I'm sorry. / The ICI has deceived many. The important thing is that you now know the truth. / I... still don't think the ICI is all bad. The ancient ways are important. / The ancient ways can preserve themselves. They don't need the ICI. / Anyway, it's about time I dropped in on Triangle and Robert. I'm not just standing here for my health. / Farewell. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?668
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?669
H... hello. / We have a lot to talk about Chosen One. First, though, I have to do my job. / Your job? / I'm with the RDCLBA now. With their resources I'm unravelling more and more of the ICI conspiracy. / In exchange, I destroy a few artifacts the RDCLBA doesn't want to get out. I see you've been working with the Starham bone. / I'm not handing it over. We both know I have the upper hand here. / Do I have to say "You don't have any hands" now? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?669
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?670
You could outcook me, but this isn't going to be a bake-off. I'm just going to take the bone and run. I doubt you'll be able to track me. / I'm standing between you and the bone. / You'll have to sleep sometime. / So you're planning to just stand there indefinitely until you have an opening. / Yes. I suppose in the meantime we might as well talk. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?670
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?671
Even if I could hurt you, I wouldn't. I don't understand the will of the Beforings, but I don't plan to interfere with it, Chosen One. All I want from you is the bone. / Arf arf arf arf arf! / What? / I think he wants to keep that bone for himself. Get out. / No! I'm not afraid of typography. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?671
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?672
Grr. Ruff! / The Food Pyramid's gonna get the bone! Stop him! / I don't think he'll get it. / Anyway, your inverted capital G looks like it's enjoying the fight. / Yeah. They're evenly matched, somehow.... / The bone's doing something again. / Rrrrr? / This seems... familiar.... / Great, now there'll have to be another sequence of exposition strips. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?672
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?673
Neither the Food Pyramid nor the inverted capital G tired. They fought for days without rest. Robert, you shouldn't be selling tickets. / There's a market demand! / We can't seat all these spectators! They keep leaving with the silverware! / Souvenirs! / You're really enjoying this, aren't you. / The bone's behavior became more and more unusual, but no effects were to be seen until a few more people arrived.... / Just what we need. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?673
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?674
YOU! Enforcer Concarne! / I'm unarmed! / I'm here to watch the fight! They're selling tickets! I have as much right to watch as anyone! / Don't even think about going for the Starbone. / Don't worry! I'm off duty! This is just for my own curiosity! / I don't believe you, but go on. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?674
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?675
That Concarne woman just bought a ticket. / We're at a plot nexus. The whole cast is converging here. / Cube teleported in last strip while you weren't looking and he's babbling about not being able to find Orpuddex. The Vegetable Sentry came in to use the bathroom and hasn't left. / Ow! Something feels... ow... / Triangle? / Too many chefs... / Were you cooking something? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?675
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?676
Triangle? What's wrong? Food poisoning? / No... cuisine-magic.. all these warriors and chefs in one place... / Robert! Get the spectators out of here! The bone's almost fully charged! Something's about to happen. / I'm feeling it too... EVERYONE OUT! YOU'LL ALL GET REFUNDS! / Robert, you too. Out. Hurry. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?676
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?677
Hey! Vegetable Sentry! Get out of the bathroom! Something's happening! / Quiet. I'm meditating. / Food Pyramid! Inverted capital G that we never bothered to name! Get away from the bone! Can't you see what it's doing? / I'm not turning back. / Arf. / Miss Concarne! Move! I'm getting out of here! / No! I think I need to see this! / Your funeral. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?677
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?678
With the Food Pyramid, the inverted capital G, the Vegetable Sentry, and Meat Enforcer Linda Concarne still inside, Triangle hastily evacuates his home. The crowd has already dispersed. / Aren't you standing sort of close? / No. Just as the Starham itself is cured beyond all logic, so to do those who consume its power become cured. / Cured? / The G, the Pyramid, and the Enforcer are in there with it because they need to be. As for the Vegetable Sentry, the conclusion is obvious. / Could you state it anyway, just for the readers at home? http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?678
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?679
The Vegetable Sentry was awakened from his slumber when he was needed. Orpuddex, by all accounts, is becoming more powerful than ever by drawing from the Tetrean pudding pumps. All four Sentries will be needed, and so all are being awakened. / When Linda Concarne touched the Starbone for the first time, she dimly remembered her past; since then he has been at least partially on your side, though she knows not why. / The logic is inescapable. Somehow, Linda Concarne was once a Meat Sentry. How she became what she became... I don't know. Hopefully the ham energies will heal her fully now that all four are assembled. / How do you know all this? / I reread the strip archive. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?679
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?680
As you have suspected, the inverted capital G you keep as a pet was not always a letter. Once, it was a Sentry, either Grain or Dairy. I believe it to have been the Dairy Sentry, for the Pyramid seems to me aligned with Grain. / As you know, the various segments of the Food Pyramid symbolize food groups. The largest, at his base, consists of the complex carbohydrates. He must be the Grain Sentry. How he forgot this... I do not understand. / We should still get out of here. Benevolent or not, that's a lot of energy. / Yes... you may be right. The air has far more calories in it than I had earlier sensed. http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?680
http://tr.froup.com/tr.pl?681
The whole point of the Food Pyramid's teachings was that there aren't necessarily four food groups... and he's one of the four Sentries? / Clearly, he was mistaken. / No. He was correct... there don't have to be four Sentries. I found this in Tetris. / A videotape? / A very, very old videotape. I suspect that the format was used by the Fourth Race. It is a documentary, and while I do not understand the language of the narration, the images tell many things. One of these many revelations is that, at the time of the height of Tetris's glory, polygons were unable to digest dairy products. How this changed I do no
