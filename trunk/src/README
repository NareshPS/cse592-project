Code Setup
----------
To run the code:
$ main.py
Before running, make sure comic files are present in ../comics directory.
The code creates corpus-wide feature vector, instance-wide feature vector
and a stop word list and stores them on disk. These vectors are
created only during first run. For subsequent runs, it loads the 
vectors from the disk. It saves computation time. If anything is 
changed in vector construction related code, run:
$./main.py clean

This will delete previously stored state. Fresh vectors will be constructed
in the next run.

Refer to comments in the code for clustering algorithm and related details.
