Code Setup
----------
To run the code:
$ main.py
Before running, make sure comic files are present in ../comics directory.
This code creates Hierarchial Co-clustering of web-comics.
It reads the comics from the above directory and creates language models
for each comic series. Then it get the probability of each comic from
the models. This information is used to create a relationship matrix.
The relationship matrix is a seriesXcomic(document) matrix. Once the matrix
is constructed, we run HCC algorithm to co-cluster comics with their series.
The cluster thus obtained is visualized using ETE package.
Note, that whole processing is done only in first run. For subsequent runs, it loads the 
state from the disk. It saves computation time. If anything is 
changed in vector construction related code, run:
$./main.py clean

This will delete previously stored state. Fresh vectors will be constructed
in the next run.

Refer to comments in the code for clustering algorithm and related details.
