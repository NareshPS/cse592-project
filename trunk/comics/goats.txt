Goats comic strip from January / 03 / 2000: tastes like chicken candy bars and the Y2K love bunker (11)
You would have thought that this year 2000 stuff would have died down once it was here.  It's still all over the T.V. / You mean... Television 2000! /  / It's like the news was relying on Y2K bug stories, and now that nothing's happened, they're running ridiculous filler- the first baby of "The New Millenium." / Babies 2000! /  / Stop that.  It's annoying as hell. / Annoyance 2000!

So if the last decade was the nineties, what's this decade called? / It's not clear. The best one I've heard is "The Naughties." /  / Don't tell Toothgnip that. It's bad enough as is. What about the next one? / Dunno. The teens? But that won't make sense between 2010 and 2012. /  / I suppose those would be the pre-teens. / Great. Three years of barbie nail polish and Ricky martin pin-ups.

Did you guys come here to take over the planet or something? / Initially. But it's not really worth all the effort.   /  / Why don't you start off small, then?

As you both know, I was once heavily involved in the European bocce circuit due to the influence of my one-eyed, robotic-limbed Frenchman friend, Shazam Twix. After losing his job in the vineyards of epernay due to what the authorities termed "excessive drug use", sport was his only solace. /  / He did rather well for himself on the circuit, as many of the other players were of similar character, and helped to mask his eccentricities. Despite his tendency to become sidetracked in debates with invisible giraffes, he was an exemplary player, and rarely licked anyone without prior permission. /  / Twix was ranked third on the continent until one fateful evening, when after a particularly frenetic binge hopped up on mainlined cocoa and fetus extract, he accidentally ate a referee. Such things were frowned upon in the world of bocce.

After a brief but violent discussion with the Bocce Tribunal, Twix was banished from the sport for referee consumption ahnd excessive flatulence.  Having first lost his job (and access to the luscious and morally-challenged champagne cellar tour guides), and now with his precious bocce taken away, he was crushed. /  / The next three months were an endless torment for both Twix and myself, as I had to repeatedly talk him down from his experimentations with the hallucinogenic effects of Ham 'n' Cheese Hot Pocket overdosing.  He babbled endlessly about his "next big thing." /  / After toying with flawed (the Monkey Fund: a mutual fund run by monkeys, investing only in monkey-friendly stocks) and hopeless (the Hootie Channel: all Hootie, all the time) business ideas, Shazam Twix decided to re-enter the world of sport.  But this time, he would rise through the ranks of head-to-head roller-biathlon.

We packed Twix's 1981 Mercury Zephyr with the meager contents of our squatter's flat (a toilet brush, a variety of sporting goods, and 15 kilos of Nutella) and headed for Belgium. /  / Life on the road was grand... there were sheep... and some additional sheep... man, there were a lot of sheep.  They were everywhere.  Pretty much a sheep anywhere you looked.  They ate grass and walked around a bit. /  / I guess it's hard to keep the action flowing when you're making stuff up on the spot.  / I am not.  Sheep are integral to the tone of the story. / Were the sheep beautiful?

After several days of adventure on the road (and a quick stop at "Mini-Europe" for photos), we arrived at our new flat in Brussels, overlooking the Grand-Place.  Getting into the spirit of the city, Twix shared his "Manneken Pis" impression with the tourists below our balcony. /  / After unloading the Zephyr, we struck out on the cobblestone streets of the city, looking for frites and head-to-head roller-biathlon sparring partners.  We found frites; it was somewhat harder to find people willing to take a bullet in the name of sport. /  / As we walked, the bright pink of a photocopied flyer taped to a lamppost caught my eye.  I plucked it from the post.  It was an advertisement for the upcoming roller-biathlon tournament, to be held right there in Brussels, two weeks from the day.  I turned to show Twix, but he was nowhere to be seen.

Suddenly, I found myself as alone as a fat girl on a Friday night*.  Shazam Twix was gone, with only a few oddly-shaped leaves blowing in circles where he had stood moments before.  It was getting dark, and I felt a pressing need to get off the streets. / *No, I'm not calling you fat.  Get over yourself. /  / I ducked into a nearby bar, aptly named "Planet Cocktail Bar."  It was packed with greasy Belgians sipping fruit-laden drinks, swaying to trance-inducing house music.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than Planet Cocktail Bar. /  /  /  / I ordered my customary Long Island Iced Tea, and sat myself down in a booth with three blonde Belgian beauties.  I spoke to them the only French phrase that Twix had taught me: "I, too, enjoy the soccer."  But those five words were more than enough...

Having read as much Brussels-specific tourist literature as possible, I was keenly aware of the native reverence for the art of comics.  I was also keenly aware that Belgians were as easy as mac 'n' cheese.  I plied the buxom blondes with tales of my career as a comic stripper back in the States. /  / My three dates were so overwhelmed by my stunning (albeit fabricated) revelation that they immediately invited me back to their sorority house for a sweaty, sticky three-way.  Just then, I noticed another of those oddly-shaped leaves on the floor of the bar. /  / My mind returned to Shazam Twix and his disappearance.  I recalled the words he had spoken to me just that morning: "Toast is just over-cooked bread."  And I knew then that he was right.  Determined to find Twix, I sent the girls on their way with only my promise to call them.

Goats comic strip from March / 21 / 2000: the world's strongest man (and the twix saga, pt. 2) (12)
Something about the oddly-shaped leaves triggered a memory.  On a hunch, I followed the trail of leaves towards the back of Planet Cocktail Bar, through a brightly-colored beaded curtain.  The beads were pretty.  Pretty, pretty beads. /  / Were they pretty in the way that post-nose job Jennifer Grey is pretty? / More in a fully-loaded pizza sort of way. / Hello?  Story? /  / I think she was prettier before the nose job. / Jon, I think you could stand to relax a bit. / Diablo, I think you've been smoking too many of those oddly-shaped leaves.

Goats comic strip from March / 22 / 2000: the world's strongest man (and the twix saga, pt. 2) (13)
I pulled aside the beaded curtain.  There, in the back room of Planet Cocktail Bar, was none other than my nemesis, the evil Gregor Mendel, father of modern genetics and ex-wrestling champion! /  / How did he survive the explosion with which we had detroyed his laboratory?  What was he doing here in Brussels?  Why did his skin now have an eerie green tinge to it?  Had I remembered to turn off the oven that morning?  And what had he done with Shazam Twix? /  / "Ah, Diablo, my friend," the evil one intoned, his hands rubbing together like two horny, incestuous tectonic plates.  "Finally, a chance for us to have that dim-sum we talked about so long ago.  Come, and have some of my sticky balls."
http://www.goats.com/archive/000322.html
Goats comic strip from March / 23 / 2000: the world's strongest man (and the twix saga, pt. 2) (14)
Mendel settled back into his seat and began to talk.  "Our last, shall we say, 'explosive' encounter left me with severe burns over 90% of my body.  I stitched myself together over five months of painful genetically-engineered plant-skin transplants."  /  / "Five months of torturous pain is a long time, Diablo.  Five months of nothing but pondering revenge against you and your friend Twix.  That, and reading 'Newsweek'.  And sampling different varieties of Ben 'n' Jerry's wonderful ice cream flavors." /  / "And, of course, the occasional game of Yahtzee, but, as we all know, my sentient pea-plant henchmen aren't very good game players, so there was little challenge there.  They often ate the dice.  But mostly, I pondered revenge.  Revenge and monkeys.  Monkeys are funny."

Goats comic strip from March / 24 / 2000: the world's strongest man (and the twix saga, pt. 2) (15)
Mendel chewed thoughtfully on his pork buns.  "Once I had recovered from the skin transplants, I found that I no longer had the upper-body strength to maintain my wrestling career.  Only the solace of thrice-daily pints of 'Phish Food' kept me from slipping into permanent depression." /  / "I needed a new way to generate income to fund my genetic engineering, world-domination and revenge-related activites.  I did a brief stint at the home 'n' garden department of 'Home Despot', but $6.20 an hour doesn't go as far now as it did back in the 1800s."  /  / "Clearly, I needed a new sport to dominate- a sport that catered to my violent impulses and love for phallic symbolism.  A sport dripping in cash and blood.  I decided then that I would counquer the world of head-to-head roller-biathlon."

Mendle continued his spiel.  "Of course, now that you and Twix have conveniently delivered yourselves to me, my elaborate plans for revenge have been foiled.  But, as I am a somewhat sporting villian, and not altogether bright, I suggest we have a small competition." /  / "We will pit my army of robotic basketball players against your beloved Harlem Globetrotters.  The loser will be killed, and the winner will be given the deed to Gilligan's Island."  I reminded Mendel that he had neither the robots nor the deed to the fictional isle. /  / After some discussion, we agreed that Mendel and Twix would meet in deadly combat at the upcoming head-to-head roller-biathlon competition, deciding once and for all who would reign over the H.T.H.R.B.L, and who would perish.

Mendel's henchmen returned Shazam Twix to me, somewhat battered but without any permanent damage.  We retired to our Brussels flat, where Twix began the recovery process with a bongful of Chex Mix and Tabasco sauce. /  / The two-week training period began in earnest the following day.  I put Twix on a strict diet of Chinese take-out (beefpork with chicken) and "Lemur Patrol" cereal (marshmallows shaped like militant lemurs, part of this complete breakfast.) /  / Twix's training regimen consisted of daily strolls through the neighborhood park (armed with a quiver of baguettes in case of mime attack) and frequent games of ski-ball at "Eddie's World of Ski-Ball."  Twix won a stuffed salamander.

The two surviving combatants, Twix and Mendel, stepped into the arena to face off for the head-to-head roller-biathlon finals.  The tension was as thick as a community college student.  The referee blew his whistle, and the match began. /  / BLAM  / BLAM /  / Overtime is rarely a concern in head-to-head roller-biathlon.

Let's ignore, for a moment, that I have never heard such an anticlimactic ending in all my life.

Would you be so kind as to explain?  /  / You have to look deep within yourself for  that answer, jon. / I'll look deep within you.  Someone get me a knife. / I learned that violence is good.

Negativity isn't going to help Phillip win, Jon. / Neither are rambling inspirational speeches.

We're going to K-mart.  Wanna come? / There's a K-mart in Manhattan? /  / Two, actually.  All the cool kids go to the one on Astor. / A K-mart in the city!  You know what this means? /  / That America is homogenizing into one big redneck Midwestern mall? / It means I can buy toilet paper in bulk again.  I'm so jazzed.

You should treat me with more respect. / I can't imagine why. /  / Because I might not want to be your pet anymore. / Perdon me whilst I asphyxiate from an endless bout of laughter. /  / And people who have pets have been shown to live longer, happier lives. / That's because they always have an emergency food supply.

We're going to have to search you, sir. / Search me?  Why? / It's for America.  Bend over, sir. /  / Wow, that looks painful. / Sometimes patriotism means making sacrifices, Phillip. /  / And sometimes patriotism means you take it up the ass, apparently. / Our right to shop for housewares in a safe environment outweighs his right to anal sovereignty.

If I'm going to do this woman thing, I've got to learn how to do it properly. / Most women just let Oprah tell them what to think. /  / An excellent start.

Suzie, if I'm not a woman, then why do I have this uncontrollable desire to dress in women's clothing? /  / Well, you spend a lot of time around women. You appreciate our fashion taste.

So are you ready? / Well, the band is booked, catering is done, and I've scouted the chapel for places to hide bottles of scotch. So, yeah. /  / That's not what I meant. / You mean, am I emotionally ready to commit myself to one woman for the rest of my life? /  / Yeah. / You forget, I have no emotions. /  / You know that isn't true. / I exhibit carefully orchestrated visceral reactions to external stimuli designed to fool the casual onlooker. /  / I'm sure Lauren would be thrilled to hear that. / Oh, I've told her all of this already. /  / And she's fine with it? / She appeared upset, but I'm pretty sure it was just a carefully orchestrated visceral reaction.

Shouldn't you be off getting ready for the wedding? / Nah. I still have three units of time. /  / Units? / With each unit being defined as one-third of the total amount of time. /  / So punctuality isn't much of an issue if your units are arbitrary, huh? / Exactly. And that means I still have time for three more units of beer.

Unless something is on fire, I don't want to hear about it. / How many dates can I bring to the wedding? /  / None, Toothgnip. It's a small wedding. / Because if I'm limited to one, then Sandra, Bobbi-Ann and Lynette are gonna have a three-way conniption. /  / Only people in long-term relationships were invited with dates. / I suppose I could just take Suzie, but I reserve the right to supplemental bridesmaids.

Jon, I... I feel somewhat responsible for Fish's suicide. / We're all sad about it, Diablo, but it's not anyone's fault. /  / Well, I kind of actively encouraged him to set off a chain of events that I knew would inevitably end with him getting his hopes and dreams crushed. /  / I don't know what to say, Diablo.  You must feel terrible. / I can't get all self-righteous if you're going to be so understanding about this.  Can't you yell at me just a little?

I'd just like to say a few words, if it's okay.  Fish was a good soul.  He liked beer.  He liked gravel.  Even though he wasn't good at retaining knowledge, he spent his life in pursuit of it.  And he was our friend. /  / I will miss Fish, but I take solace in the fact that wherever he's gone, it will be a better place, because he won't have to talk to Jon there. / Hey. / You know, that's not such a bad trade-off.

Shazam Twix, My robotic-limbed mentor from the fields of Epernay, had voluntarily committed himself after a particularly harrowing session of "Waffle Diddlers Anonymous" had brought memories of his dalliance with Menstrua, Queen of the Kotex, gushing out from his cerebrum like that gum with the squishy center. /  / In an effort to quelch the reawakened feelings of longing and betrayal at the hands of super-minx Menstrua, Twix retreated to the psychological safety of padded walls and apple juice afternoons. Years of Chex Mix abuse had left him ill-equipped to deal with rejection. /  / Twix spent his long, dreary days working with the other patients, teaching them how to impale things with a meat thermometer and how to glue popsicle sticks to their foreheads. He spent his nights screaming in horror.

I found Twix in the sanitarium's cafeteria, writing and re-writing potential online personal ads on the back of paper napkins (the safe king with the sharp edged removed) with a piece of ketchup-soaked wonder bread. "Shazam!" I yelled, trying to get his attention. He glanced at the ceiling, barked loudly, and returned to his scribbles. /  / I walked over to his trable and caught his eye, but there was no recognition. I recounted our adventures trying to stir his memory: fighting the hyper-weasels of finland. Battling the market-droids of SuperAwesomeCorp. Eating flan during the Fabulous Flan Floods of '93. None of it broke through his trance. /  / Resigned, I sat across from him and corrected his spelling and grammar as he wrote his personal ads (well-hung pastry chef seeks hairy dwarf-lady for sucking jello through straws, midnight walks), my tears smearing the ketchup-enscribed come-ons as I proofed them.

I edited Twix's lascivious personal ads (which, bound in a single column, would approximate a sort of Kama Sutra for breakfast food aficionados) one by one, until he had but a single paper napkin in front of him. Slowly, Twix looked up at me for the first time with clear eyes and passed me the final note. /  / Help. I am trapped in a small jar next to Jerry Lewis in a cave in southern New Jersey. Please help me escape. Thank you for your time and consideration. Your friend, / The note, scrawled in his childlike handwriting, said "Middle-aged robotic-limbed Belgian seeks Satan-worshipping chicken for adventures, kicking ass, and general mayhem. Must like bocce and forgiving self-pitying whiners for their occasional lapses in mental faculty and their sexual transgressions with underage waffles. /  / Twix stood up, dusted himself off, and turned to me with the same disarming smile he had used to deflower all those champagne cellar tour guides those many years ago. "Diablo," he said, "did you know that in West Virginia, it is against the law for non-babies to ride in baby carriages?" / He was back.

After helping ourselves to some apple cobbler (which had turned out to be load-bearing cobbler, bringing down the cafeteria and the rest of the sanitarium in a glorious pile of screaming bodies and rubble), we made our way to the nearest high-speed hovercraft budget rental outfit. /  / Roar! / We crossed the sea of Brussels under cover of darkness, making our way towards Gregor Mendel's lair, knowing full well that he did not like us and was probably still miffed about all the times we had killed him previously. Suddenly, a vicious shark reared out of the water! But then it went away. /  / We finally made it to the opposite shore, just outside the sleepy, tiny hamlet of Ouderengaardefleurn, where Mendel's castle lay. It was a risky mission, and there was no guarantee that any of us would survive. I released the hovercraft, setting it free. We watched in silence as the hovercraft made it's way to safety, floating ever higher and higher into the night sky.

Boarded up window with sinister eyes peeping out. / Mendel's castle lay at the top of an angry pile of rock jutting out above the quiet, sleepy town.  But as we strolled the empty streets of Ouderengaardefleurn, it became clear that not everything was asleep.  Beady eyes and grasping fingers poked out from behind boarded windows and under porches. /  / We quickened our pace, aware that we were being tracked by some sinister force, something far darker than even Mendel's genetic tampering was capable of, like a sitcom reunion special, or a Taco Bell soda fountain with the Pepsi syrup output turned way down. /  / Whatever we sensed, they let us pass through the town unharmed, perhaps kept at bay by a disturbingly steady stream of Twix's world-famous robotic armpit farts, or perhaps, by the twisted hand of fate.  But fate appreciates irony, because while we were escaping that unknown threat, we walked right into another. / BRAP BRAP

In our rush to escape the vague dread instilled in us by the ghoulish town, we ran straight into one of Mendel's patrols of his sentient mutant pea-plant henchmen.  Twix began to hack away at their tentacles with his machete, but we were quickly overcome by their sheer numbers. /  / With their long, hard, throbbing protuberances wrapped around our lithe, tender bodies, there was little we could do.  The pea plants carried us like a pair of knock-off Fendi handbags up the slope of the rocky outcropping towards Gregor Mendel's stony lair, where certain death (and tacky faux-medieval interior decoration) awaited us. /  / Once inside the castle, we were shackled in the dungeon/breakfast nook, roughed up a bit, and given our choice of herbal tea.  Just then, Mendel himself entered the room, wringing his hands like impish towels soaked in the cast-off sweat of Natalie Imbruglia.  "Hello, friends," he said.  "Care for a scone?  A scone of DOOM?!?"

While Twix became visibly aroused at the mere mention of scones, I kept my cool, like Steve McQueen's corpse in an interstellar void.  "We're not here for your demented pastry, Mendel," I spat at him.  "We've come because... Well...  We need your help."  Mendel's twisted smile of schadenfreude twisted into a twisted smirk of surprise. /  / "You want my help?"  he laughed, clearly enjoying his power over us.  "Whatever for?"  Swallowing my pride, I explained to him what had happened to Fish; the events leading up to his suicide and how I had caused it.  "Fish is dead," I said, "And we need your help to make him less dead." /  / "It would be an intriguing challenge," Mendel mused.  "And the fish lives in a beer mug, you say?  I find that strangely amusing.  Yes, I think I will help you, my chickeny nemesis.  But there will be a price to be paid for my assistance.  And the cost will be higher than a Volkswagen bus full of hippies on a mountaintop."

"The small town below us used to be filled with cheerful villagers, going about their dreary lives with their Sony Walkmen and their sugarless gum," Mendel continued.  "But over the years, they have slowly been drawn into a cult... A cult based on the worship of a zombie who promotes the practice of ritual cannibalism." /  / "You mean Catholics?" I asked.  "No, not Catholics," Mendel responded.  "These cultists are even worse.  They make Catholics look like small potatoes.  I admit that I am uncertain as to where they procure the potato costumes from, and clueless as to how they coerce the Catholics to wear them, however.  But that is unimportant." /  / "If I am to help you revive your friend, I will need you to go into the town below, infiltrate the cultists, kidnap their zombie leader, and bring him back to me.  We will need the zombie to achieve our goal.  It is unlikely that you will survive, but if you do, please bring back some Diet Pepsi.  I am very thirsty."

Look, it's pretty obvious where this is going.  Lori is obviously the zombie cult leader.  You infiltrated the cult, fought off their battalion of evil zombie corn dog warriors, and captured her in a magical net made from the golden locks of Ann Landers.  So, in the interests of time and sanity, can we just pick up the story there? /  / You selfish, cold-hearted bastard, you've made him cry. / I... *sniff* I just wanted to tell a story... /  / I can't believe this. / It's okay, Diablo.

It took all of our strength to keep Lori restrained.  She was a snarling, blood-thirsty beast, determined to devour us alive.  Once we returned to the castle with our captive, Mendel took her off to his laboratory, where he shut himself in for the next three days and nights. /  / Just as I had finally come to terms with Lori's sudden and unexpected reappearance, she was whisked away once more.  While the cultists beat helplessly against the castle walls, screaming for her return, Mendel worked feverishly as he pried the secrets of the undead from Lori's unholy living corpse. /  / As the sun set on the third day, the cultists ended their siege, and Mendel emerged from the lab with a small vial of zombie essence, a re-animated (and very relaxed looking) Lori, and a cigarette.  "Was it good for you?" he asked slyly.  "I feel like a new woman," Lori replied.

"This vial contains all the vital zombie humours you'll need to reanimate your fishy friend," Mendel said as he passed me the test tube.  "I've renoodled the proportions I've extracted from your zombie friend to compensate for the brain frenzy and to boost their efficiency, of course." /  / "And as for you, my dark temptress," he said to Lori, "are you sure you won't reconsider my generous offer?"  "Perhaps some day," she answered.  I never did find out what Mendel was referring to, but it probably had absolutely nothing to do with DIRTY, DIRTY SEX. /  / "Well, normally at this point, I would double-cross you or something, but I'm feeling pretty good.  You're all free to go," Mendel said, and sent us on our way with some Cheese 'n' Cracker Snack Packs (the kind with the little red plastic stick that you can use to smear the cheese on the crackers).

So we said goodbye to Twix, and caught the next bus back to New York.  The only thing that's left to do now is to go dig up Fish's corpse. /  / Even assuming that you can bring Fish back to life with what appears to be a tube full of Sprite, there's probably not much raw material left to work with, if you catch my drift. /  / Jon, he lived in a glass of alcohol.  Fish is probably better preserved than most fetal pigs I know. / Ooh!  Can I come?  I haven't gone graverobbing in weeks.

Wow, Arnaud! Nice office you got here! / No time for pleasantries. We've got a pitch to a client in....twelve hours. /  / No sweat. We did eight hours once, remember? / But this time we're bidding against Hot-Dog-On-A-Stick. /  / Ooh. Scary. / Hot-Dog-On-A-Stick killed my parents.

Mike, it's been far too long.  How goes it? / Oh, you know me, still the same old carefree "I'll do anything for a buck" fun-guy hipster. /  / Since I left Soylent, I've been working on some personal projects.  This summer we found a subculture of mole people in some abandoned subway tunnels that were really into the speed-quilting scene.  I started an e-commerce site specializing in infrared hornrimmed glasses and phosphorescent yarn. /  / Speed-Quilting? / Yeah, apparently it gets really, really boring down there.

So what's the project? / The client wants a value-driven inventory tracking and scalable e-consolidation portal with real-time supply-chain optimization featuring cross-channel integration with legacy stuff. /  /  / Do you even know what that is? / No, but neither does the client. / I think we should make it bright orange.

...and the site nav is self-configuring, so maintenance should be a breeze. / That's all good and fine, but what we really need is a snappy name for it. /  / I've got it. How about the "Relational Asset Tracking Goal-Oriented Network And Database"? /  / You want to call it R.A.T.-G.O.N.A.D.? / Well, it's undeniably memorable. / And the domain name is available too.

The next project I want to work on is a biggie. As you might guess, the sixth level has a bit of a poor reputation as a vacation spot. We're looking to bring in more tourists. Families, if possible. /  / You want us to do an online ad campaign promoting hell as an alternative to Disneyworld? / Personally, I think we have better rides. /  / "Hell: it's not just painful disembowelments by a Taco-Spork-wielding-madman for all eternity anymore!" / I'd go a bit less wordy.

They're claiming that our Sporkle Xtreme energy beverage-style product is responsible for Fish's transformation and general post-transformational malaise. / So? Write them a check. /  / They want your collection of antique bingo chips. / Those BASTARDS. I will defend my honor in hand-to-hand combat! /  / Would you put that down? We're still paying the vet bills from the last time. / Those poodles had it coming. You don't see me going around with a shaved ass. I have DIGNITY.

We're going to need a new lawyer. Our current one is very dead. / You know what would be more fun for you than three weeks of legal proceedings? /  / What? / Spending three weeks manning my booth for me at a comics convention in Las Vegas, Nevada. /  / Do I get to beat up nerds? / That depends on how close you can get to them. The con geek is known to emit a powerful "aroma shield array".

Elfies / We're going where? / I got a letter from the head arrangement fellow of DOR-CON 17. Apparently, he is in charge of arranging things. /  / Xeroxed letterhead. Classy! / I, the auteur of online comic phenomenon MEGAGAMERZ 3L33T, have been invited to appear as a Dor-Con guest of honor. /  / You have seven readers, and four of those are Google search bots. / And yet I can still go unrecognized on the street, which is nice.

Did you catch that wizard at the front of the hotel? / No. Really? / He's animatronic. /  / Don't be so harsh, Dude. Wizards need love too. / Yeah. Don't be a wizard-hater. / I just meant that he's not a real wizard. /  / Not like we used to have back in the day, but the economy isn't all it used to be. / Oh man.

I have my first panel in twelve minutes. You two go set up our stuff at the booth. There may be some other folks there already. Try not to scare them off too quickly. / Nerds? /  / A bunch of lowlife emo-candyraver drug-addled web-cartoonists I'm loosely associated with. We have a sort of mutual non-aggression pact. / Like S.A.L.T.? /  / I used to, but now I'm on a low-sodium diet! / That's Rich. He's the witty one. / How wonderful for him.

Fascinating. It's like watching a National Geographic special on inebriates. /  / Yup.

Hello fellow Americans. We've been invited here to speak on the occasion of the 1500th Goats comic strip. /  / Now normally, Dick doesn't like to associate himself with folks like you. He's still sore from when the gays made his daughter all fruity. plus, he says I'll probably embarass him again. /  / But I told him that we have to make the first move towards a non-partisan country. We must take these sorts of opportunicalities to reach out to you liberal fruitcakes and try to show you the error of your ways. /  / Like this whole Iraq war doo-dad. You're making way too much of a fuss over it, if you look at it all analytical-like. Sure, it's an "illegal war". Sure, we made up some stuff to get the whole mess goin'. /  / But lookit all the good that's coming out of it. First off, our war crimes ain't half as bad as the ones Saddam was pullin' off. Secret murders are way down. And you gotta admit some o' them torture pics were pretty funny. /  / But the thing that we have to remember is that we're good. We're the good guys! And that means anyone who is fighting us or disagrees with us is EVIL and WRONG. /  / The Bible - By God / And how do I know that we're the good guys? Because it says so in the Bible. And how could he love me if I was doin' anything wrong? /  / So, to recap, Jesus loves me. And Jesus loves Dick. /  / I bet he can't get enough Dick, you know? I know I can't. / Cut his mic!

I never thought you'd sink so low. Running off, leaving our poor friend Fish in a state of befuddlement and poverty, unable to pay even the smallest of legal bills. As his attorney, I demand that you give me all your money. /  / Well, that's too bad, but Sporkle Corp does not negotiate with terrorists, giant killer robots, or lawyers. It's company policy, and there's nothing you can do about it. /  / There certainly is. I'm going to murder everyone at this convention, one by one, until you learn some respect for THE LAW.

Legend has it that during the revolutionary war, British troops marched through the town on their way to battle North of here. /  / As they marched, the troops sang "Yankee Doodle" in an effort to demoralize the townspeople. But the citizens picked up the tune, taking it for their own, even going so far as to rename their village after it. /  / I don't believe that for a second.  / Why not? / It's boring.

They don't want you to know what happened here, but the truth is that Doodletown was like an Auschwitz for chickens. /  / Home to a colony of antichickeners, Doodletown was a mecca for anti-chicken activity. Doodleites bred bears over on the mountain for the express purpose of destroying the chicken people. / Rar. /  / Are you done yet? / Trivia tidbit: Kwanzaa was originally conceived to commemorate the great chicken-bear massacree of 1869.

Despite what Diablo would have you believe, Doodletown was an isolated and mostly peaceful village. Time passed quietly there. /  / The townspeople made a meager but fair living chopping ice out of the nearby lake and carting it down to Manhattan, where ice was apparently hard to come by. Modern refriderants sealed the demise of their economy, and the town dissolved in April of 1965. /  / THAT'S IT. I've had enough of this revisionist propaganda. / She's a witch! Burn her!

Great. Diablo's run off. / What exactly just happened? /  / Maybe you and your holocaust-denying friends should get together and have a little chat about that.  Maybe over tea and cookies.  Heartless, cruel cookies that you eat while rewriting history to your liking. /  / Thanks. That clears everything up. / Acutally, if you've got any cookies left over afterwards, can I have them? / He likes cookies a lot.

Regardless of who is mistaken in their history, we need to split up and find Diablo before he gets hurt. / Why? /  / Good point. Okay, we need to find him before he sets fire to things. / Why? /  / Because Smokey would be peeved if we burned down his forest after all that advertising he paid for. / Once again, the iron grip of the bears holds us in its clammy paws of evil.

Where did you get a tape of me? /  / Picture of a 12 year old Megan in her bedroom, kneeling on the bed, ready to sneak out the window and run away, with her posessions in her backpack. / From when I was twelve.

This is a joke, right? Or a hallucination. Either one is fine, I'm not picky. / Look! The picture has CHANGED. /  / Megan walking away from her house with duffle bag on shoulder. Her father is consoling Megan's crying mother as they both stand in the front doorway. / That's me, leaving home for college. /  / And that's me boarding a plane to teach in Japan... And me leaving Japan for Washington... And me leaving Washington for New York... / I am beginning to sense a PATTERN!

It is a place to call HOME.

Look, Megan, I know we haven't had the easiest time of it since you moved in with me, what with the nippeless kidnappers and space mummies and whatnot. Stability is a tough thing to find in New York. /  / But for me, at least, home isn't where you are. It's about where your heart belongs. And my heart belongs with you. If you want to live here, in this creepy graveyard, then I'm going to be here by your side. This is my home too. /  / Okay. / Overwhelming guilt and sentimentality didn't work. I must be losing my touch.

Goats comic strip from September / 02 / 2004: a dish best served delicious (or, invoking godwin's law) (2)
You murdered Diablo? Again? / Ah, Jon. Always jumping to conclusions. Those aren't the questions you should be asking. /  / Are you saying that there are extenuating circumstances to this murder? / No. I'm saying your questions are boring. /  / A more interesting question might be, "Can you inject whiskey into hot dogs?" / I think we'd all like to know the answer to that.
http://www.goats.com/archive/040902.html
Goats comic strip from September / 07 / 2004: a dish best served delicious (or, invoking godwin's law) (3)
Let's think about this reasonably, Jon. / Maybe you could inject whiskey directly into the animals that hot dogs are made of. /  / Reasonably? This isn't some political discussion. It's not a partisan issue we're talking about. Murder is pretty much universally agreed upon as being a bad habit. /  / It's not that I have a lot of bad habits. I just don't have any good ones with which to contrast them. / Questions are really tough, you know?

So where did you bury the body? / Wait a second. I have a question. If you're trying to eat as many eggs as possible, should you eat them whole or scrambled? /  / Whole eggs would be difficult to pass. / But they're designed to be passed out of a chicken. / I'd like to think that my colon is stronger than a chicken. /  / C'mon guys. Let's stop stalling and go dig up Diablo's corpse. / Good idea. We need some hard, scientific comparisons.

So I must say, Toothgnip, I do find it somewhat curious that you would show up here, in the middle of the woods, to murder Diablo under completely random cicumstances, after having been strangely absent for the past ten months. /  / I understand your curiosity. It's quite a tale how I came to be here right now. One filled with romance and ladies from distant lands. One filled with equal parts courage and betrayal. And maybe... just maybe... a little bit of Hollywood magic. /  / You know, we could just bury him here next to the chicken. I've already dug the hole. / It is a very nice hole.

A truth duel? You mean a debate? / Not a debate. I propose that we settle our disagreement by determining the truth, and using that as our standard of measurement. /  / How innovative! Will we be using facts? / We will go and ask the president, who is totally nonpartisan and unbiased, whether or not he is evil. /  / As this is a duel, I imagine there is a forfeit for the loser. / Whoever loses must leave New York...forever.

Make another left at the troll. / Okay. /  / That turns right into the parking lot for the giant castle where all the Hollywood stars live. The castle guard is a tiny pink man with perfect hair. You'll need to use this special poking stick to drive him into the moat so you can pass. /  / Then, make your way past the lasers to the third floor... Are you getting all this? / How do you spell 'hot dog'?

And we scholars of genetics don't have much use for the concept of altruism. / Well, it's time to collect on that little favor I did for you. I need you to run some ERRANDS. /  / Ironically, it's the very serum I created to resurrect you that made the use of all this gadgetry possible. A normal, mortal mind would never been able to withstand the strain of memory extraction and reconstruction. /  / And I was so looking forward to breaking you. Remaking you in my own image.

You know it's just a saying. / I'm well aware. /  / So that means you don't need to take it literally. It's meant to be interpreted, like a zen koan.

Part of the USB host spec includes a power supply for attatched devices, like the display goggles we found on Fish. /  / Your point? / The power originates from his brain.

Fineas uses his super-brain to make the stunning observation that our sudden appearance on the planet of typing monkeys is not quite right. Bravo, sir. I am but a rotting pile of meat, casting a meat-shaped shadow in the light of your brilliance. /  / No. I mean Fineas. He's GONE.

You know, the real irony is that even though you're finally free of Fineas, without him you're trapped here on this world. He's the only one smart enough to figure out how to get back home.

I can't go back out there, Reese. Diablo wants me to figure out how to get us home, but I can't do that without waking up FINEAS. /  / The scariest part is... I was beginning to LIKE IT.

All YOU have done is inflict pain and cause sadness and terror wherever you have gone. /  / A killer like you isn't worthy of the unpopped kernels of corn on the sticky floor of a movie theater showing Reese's new movie "Just Like Heaven", in which she is the spirit of a coma-lady who falls in love with Mark Ruffalo.

I'm the SAFE HOOK character. /  / The safe hook character is the one guest artists will use most in THEIR strips, because they're well-known, and have a clear personality.

Page 789, third verse, right between the Uplifting of the Gorgranaax and President Cheney's re-election. /  / "...And a woman of Purity and Knack will pluck from the Void THE PROGRAMMER, whom you will know by his gray skin and love of beverages." /  / "And the Programmer will neither drink booze, nor lie with a woman nor surf erotic websites for many months. For he will breach the Skin between Worlds, and so bring about a New Age of the Multiverse, forever and ever, Amen." /  / And then it goes on for a bit about which beverages you like. / What else does it say in there about me? /  / You die choking on trail mix. / That's AWFUL. I wanted to explode in the vacuum of space.

I don't care WHAT your simulations show. This is the REAL WORLD, and I have FREE WILL. I won't be bringing about any New Ages or breaching anything's skin. /  / Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to wander out into your crops and see if I can't find myself something that will ferment. / FREE WILL is an ILLUSION. /  / The "real world" is ALSO a simulation. / Oh really. /  / The whole shebang is running off some guy's laptop. / So there's no free will? /  / Not as you think of it. / And here I was feeling guilty for all those Ambien-induced "midnight donuts".

Come with me. All o' this will make more sense if I can DEMONSTRATE. / Sure, why not? I'll just follow you around. It's not like I have FREE WILL or anything. /  / You know what? I'm being a DANNY DOWNER. A lack of free will doesn't have to be a bad thing. This opens up all sorts of possibilities for me. /  / For example, if I was to make sweet love to this cow right here, brazenly declaring our forbidden ruminant romance for all the world to see in a mad cyclone of passion and beef, well, I could hardly be blamed for that, could I? /  / Aye, you could do that. /  / I don't really want to do that, actually. / That's good news for us all.

The clutches of an oppressive, restrictive society that would use you as a pawn in their self-fulfilling prophesies, prophesies of unending proactive war across foreign dimensions, waged for the short-term economic benefit of the rich and powerful. That sort of thing. /  /  / There's an alternative? / Oh, yah. Ye can live in caves and explode things from time to time.

And you tell them if they want me to sleep in a cramped Winnebago for eight weeks, I'm getting the top bunk.  Oh...do you think we can arrange for crullers in the mornings?  Pastry is very important. /  / Who's on the phone? / My agent.  He's getting me booked on MTV's "Road Rules." /  / The phone jack is unplugged. / I know.  You'd be surprised how well it keeps the phone bills down.

It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Diablo.  I'm Ms. Richards, Associate Producer of MTV's 'Road Rules.'  I understand you're interested in joining that cast for next season. / Yup. /  / You see, Ms. Richards, while my life so far has been rich and fulfilling, Satanism just isn't enough to make a chicken's life complete.  I need to go out and see the world if I want to continue to grow.  I feel 'Road Rules' will help me. /  / Well, Mr. Diablo, that's very sweet. / And I figured being locked in a Winnebago for eight weeks with a bunch of hot babes almost guarantees me a ride on the flesh express.

Mr. Diablo, in order to keep 'Road Rules' fresh and ensure exciting discourse between cast members, we randomly select people from a wide group of varied occupations, such as underwear models and athletes. /  / Despite our unbiased selection process, we still like to make sure our applicants have something unique to offer.  What can you bring to 'Road Rules?' / I can break dance. /  / Thank you for coming, Mr. Diablo.  We'll be in touch. / I've seen "Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo" 17 times.  Wanna see me do 'The Worm'?

Are you trying out for "Road Rules" too? / Oh yeah. /  / MTV has been there for me since I was a child...telling me what to think, what to feel, saving me from all that pesky self-discovery.  I figure if I'm gonna see the world, I should do it MTV-style. /  / You're a real Renaissance man, aren't you? / Yup.  I wrote a song about my goatee.  Wanna hear?

Well, you can take your lousy show and shove it up your collective orifice, you corporate shills! /  / They reject you too? / Doesn't matter.  MTV is just a group of armpit demons eating at the souls of our youth. /  / And yet, you wanted to be on "Road Rules." / Moral dilemmas are so easily resolved when you're a nihilist.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980325.html
Goats comic strip from March / 26 / 1998: road rules and nihilism (7)
...so essentially, nihilism is a lack of belief in anything. / Is it like Satanism? /  / Nope.  Satanism impies a belief in Satan. / It's not really a belief for me, since I know him personally. /  / Really?  I bet he can get you some really neat stuff. / Not really.  Just socks and underwear on my birthday.

Excuse me, sir, but this chicken says he belongs to you. /  / Cheryl?  Is that you? / Oh... Jon.  Hi. /  / Marry me. / You know, as greetings go, "hi" is somewhat more socially acceptable.  "How have you been" would also do.

Goats comic strip from March / 29 / 1998: road rules and nihilism (9)
So where did you two run into each other? / Well, we were both at MTV Studios, trying out for "Road Rules"...  /  / ...When suddenly, the building was under attack by mutant terrorists.  My kung-fu was useless.  They opened fire, and we all died. /  / Diablo, don't you have somewhere to be? / Was that over the top? / Just a tad.

You look quite a bit different than the last time I saw you. / I'm a nihilist now.  People expect me to look the part. /  / Hence, the basic black. / Well, anything's better than dressing like a yuppie corporate slave. /  / Hey. / Oh, don't get all huffy.  It looks good on you...a 'conformist chic' sorta thing.

Goats comic strip from March / 31 / 1998: road rules and nihilism (11)
Cheryl, the last time I heard from you was right before you went off on your business trip...How come you never called? /  / Well, Jon, it was on that trip that I realized I was a nihilist.  Since I don't believe in love, it seemed pointless to call. /  / So I take it you don't believe in celibacy? / True.  But I don't believe you're getting lucky tonight either.

What's up? / I'm trying to figure out the most efficient way to win the McDonald's Monopoly contest. /  / Most people would think that the best way to do it would be to write away for game pieces.  Not true.  It costs 64 cents round-trip, and the requests have to be handwritten.  The key, my friend, is hash browns. /  / Have you been sucking the propellant out of empty Easy-Cheez cans again? / Maybe.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980402.html
Goats comic strip from April / 03 / 1998: monopoly (2)
What in the world are those? / McDonald's hash browns.  Two chances to win the Monopoly contest on each one. /  / You'll never win.  They put out half a billion game pieces. / There's three more crates of them in the hallway. /  / Half a billion, Phillip. / We'll succeed through division of labor.  You peel off the game pieces, I'll eat the hash browns.

I...I found the "Boardwalk" game piece.  We just won a million dollars. / Is that a good thing? /  / Yes.  It's a good thing. / Excellent.  This is just what I need to fund my crime-fighting exploits. /  / I think I just wet myself. / I'd like to thank my mom, Gallagher, and Enid, Goddess of Condiments.

We've just won a million dollars, and tax season is right around the corner. / Who can we turn to? /  / When the I.R.S. rears its ugly head, you can always turn to... / Ken Hauptman, Certified Public Accountant / Able to hide money in alternate dimensions / Less crooked than some other CPAs / Never convicted of that thing you may have heard of / Can add numbers together!

Goats comic strip from April / 07 / 1998: monopoly (5)
Well, gentlemen, normally if someone came to me after winning a million dollars, I'd congratulate them.  Unfortunately, this situation presents some problems. /  / The terms of your prize state that you'll receive 4,000 yearly installments of $250.  However, you owe a tax bill of $400,000.00 on the total amount in 8 days.  Frankly, you're screwed. /  / I suggest you prepare yourselves to spend some time in debtor's prison, or consider selling your internal organs to raise cash. / Don't let them take my liver, Jon.

Where are we going to find $400,000 to pay our income tax? / Maybe this potato can help. / What? / I think the potato has psychic powers.  Maybe it can tell us what to do. / Potatoes aren't the answer to everything, Phillip. / Shh...it's trying to say something.

Goats comic strip from April / 09 / 1998: monopoly (7)
What's up? / I put this new accounting software on my computer so I could try to figure out how to solve our financial crisis, and it trashed my hard drive. /  / I think I have an idea.  I can use this Psychic Potato ? as a conduit to read the files directly from your hard drive using my mind.  Think of it as psychic data recovery. /  / You're beginning to scare me, Phillip. / I see a one...followed by...a zero.

Goats comic strip from April / 10 / 1998: monopoly (8)
If we're going to pay our $400,000 income tax bill in six days, we'd better come up with a wacky get-rich-quick scheme. /  / I can run my psychic data recovery company.  That'll make us money. / I can become a defense contractor. /  / Those sound adequately zany. / Defense contractor? / I have fifty barrels of weapons-grade plutonium back home.

Toothgnip, we've got until Wednesday to pay our $400,000 tax bill.  Diablo and Phillip are far too retarded to come up with the cash. / You don't say. /  / I need you to come up with a way to earn the money, or we're screwed.  Help me, Toothgnip, you're my only goat. / I'll see what I can do. /  / Sex Therapy - 5? / The doctor is in.

Neil, I can't believe you would be so insensitive as to bring up the mouse incident. / Hey, it's not my fault that your idea of a romantic evening involves rodents and K-Y Jelly. /  / Oh yeah?  Well, I'm not the one with the penchant for little boys and vegetables. / At least my mom's 1-900 number isn't responsible for revitalizing the economy. /  / Still paying off the medical bills for the ruptured colon. / Girls, stop it.

It seems like you and Bob have been having some difficulties. / I just can't put up with his sexual antics, Lynda.  It's getting out of control. /  / Antics? / Perverse, horrid things.  Gerbils.  Trail mix.  Patrick Dempsey movies.  Leather and lubricants. /  / Having a rodent fetish doesn't mean he can't be a productive member of society.

Bob, this obsession with the mice...it's perverse.  I can't deal with it anymore.  I've signed you up for therapy. / Therapy? /  / You can't psychoanalyze love...You can't treat romance.  The boundaries of species cannot keep Fluffy and I apart.  Why must you deny us our love?  Why must you be so harsh, so judgmental? /  / I wouldn't be so judgmental if you weren't such a sick freak. / We're eloping, you know.

You know, I used to be intelligent...devious...a model Satanist.  But, over the past year, I've felt myself become slow.  Harmless.  I can't remember the last time I plotted to overthrow a government or torture children. /  / What kind of influence could have caused me to lose my edge?

Jon, I've come to realize that since I moved in with you and Phillip, I've become soft.  Your pitiful geek lifestyles have rubbed off on me.  I have to go and rediscover my Satanic roots elsewhere. /  / Well Diablo, this is quite a step for you...The outside would can be harsh.  Did you bring a jacket?  Do you want me to pack you a bologna sandwich? / Stop patronizing me.  I'm serious. /  / Hey Phillip!  Come see this...Our little Diablo is going off to find himself.  It's so cute! / I'm not cute, dammit.  I'm evil.  Evil, I say.

So Diablo is just gone? / Yup.  He said he needed to rediscover his evil side. /  / He could have just taken a look at the condition of the pub bathrooms.  What could be more evil? / Well, you could be in the bathroom with a cage on your head.  With a rat in the cage.  A hungry rat. /  / And then, after the rat is done eating your face, it orders a Bud Light. / Ooh.  I'm gonna have nightmares tonight.

So, it seems that Diablo's going off to learn how to be evil. / Sounds good.

Hi.  I'm interested in taking an intro course in pure evil. / Well, we don't really offer a course like that. /  / The closest course we have is a graduate class - Evil 503: Advanced Cruelty Theory. / Nothing for the novice? /  / Well, personally, I recommend Marketing 101 and Politics 101.  Both excellent refresher courses for basic evil. / Perfect.

...and that's everything on the syllabus for Evil 101: Introduction to Evil.  Your total is $530.95. / Are you joking? /  / You mean to tell me that I'm paying thousands of dollars to take a simple intro class, and even though the professor is a trained professional, I still need $500 in books to make up for his inadequacies?  Why... thats...  /  / Evil? / Well, I was thinking "expensive," but I guess that's why I need a refresher course.

You know, young man, if you really want to learn about evil, you're not going to find it in a book. /  / Book learnin' is for sissies and liberals.  Look at me...never made it past the third grade, but I've created more evil than Hitler, and damaged more young, impressionable minds than the Power Rangers and Barney combined. /  / Aaron Spelling? / Shh.

Goats comic strip from May / 04 / 1998: diablo goes to school (8)
Ask away, Mr. Spelling. / Diablo, if you really want to be my apprentice in evil, I'm going to have to ask you a few questions first. /  / You're going to be creating T.V. shows that don't just hurt people.  These shows set back the growth of society as a whole.  Can you handle that? / As long as it pays well. /  / I think we can begin now, Mr. Diablo. / Good.  When do we start destroying peoples' self-images with impossibly beautiful role models?

Goats comic strip from May / 05 / 1998: diablo goes to school (9)
The best way to start your education is to show you slides of the various T.V. shows I've made, and explain their evil purposes. /  / This first one is "The Love Boat."  Not only was it vapid and brainless, but it destroyed the careers of everyone who appeared on it - sans one. / Who? /  / Gopher.  Damn second-rate hack is a Congressman now. / Is it too late in the season to arrange for a skiing accident?

Where's the cruelty?  Where's the dismemberment and pain?  When do we learn how to crush people's souls? /  / True evil comes with time and planning, Diablo, not extravagant schemes.  The key is subtlety. / We don't do 'subtle' here at "Goats," Aaron.

Sayonara to Mr. Spelling.  I've signed up for a class in Demonology. / Diablo, I'm saddened to hear that.

So, what exactly is involved in this online dating thing? / It's relatively simple. /  / You fill out a form on their web site, detailing your personality, your quirks, your interests.  You spill your soul out for the world to see.  Then, women judge you strictly on your physical stats, like so much meat. /  / Sounds perfect for a masochist like yourself. / Yup.

It's not like you can just go out and buy a baby. / Already taken care of. /  / Diablo... / They had a blue-light special at K-Mart.  I panicked.

They're really addictive. /  / Please tell me that you didn't do anything stupid with them. / No, no.  They're safe and sound.  Just look up. /  / You nailed them to the ceiling. / Hell, no.

Diablo, you know I'm not much of a stickler for the rules, but I draw the line at stealing people's babies and taping them to the ceiling.  You have to bring them back. /  / Beer, please. /  / All right, but next week we bring them back. / They should be able to do this with nachos by that point.

Uh...hi, you must be my date.  I'm... / Silence!!  I have no interest in you, or your llama. /  / I am Gretchen Van Hooberfloosen, and this is my accordion, Heidi.  You will lick Heidi.  Now.  Show Heidi your tongue!  Or you will suffer dire consequences. /  / What sort of consequences? / I am not at liberty to say, except that they will be dire, and you will suffer them.

Uh. / Silence, infidel!!  Your girlish voice destroys the pure sound of my accordion. /  / Now, purile eunich, you will remain silent as I play for you.  You will rate my music on a scale of one to ten, in categories of size, texture, flavor, and beef by-products. /  / I found my thrill...on Blueberry Hill... / Help.

Gee, well, Gretchen, it's been fun, but... / Keep your mouth shut, you infantile putrescent monkey. /  / Our mating ritual has come to an end.  You will now take me to your domicile and pleasure me as only a man could.  You may use your man-flesh, a turkey baster, or similar toys. /  / That sounds swell, but I really have to, uh...cut my toenails.  / I will bite them off in the throes of our passion.

What's wrong? / Gretchen just called.  She doesn't want to see me again. /  / It's bad enough that women run screaming when they see me.  It's bad enough that 85% of my ex-girlfriends are now lesbian guerillas.  But now I've been dumped by a psychotic accordion player because she's decided to date her poodle. /  / Toothgnip...go get the tranquilizer darts. / It won't help...this man needs nicotine. / This is all Jerry Springer's fault!!

Yesterday's episode of 'Goats' featured two panels, in which the only artwork was a pair of crudely-drawn shoes.  While some readers have praised the artist for his minimalist genius, others claim he's a lazy bastard.  Who's right?  We'll find out today as...Readers Respond! /  / He calls himself an artist?  Ha!  That lazy commie should be stripped naked and rubbed against Pol Pot's rotting corpse. / I don't think we should be so hard on him.  I, too, know the pain of having no talent. / He's dreamy.  He reminds me of Tommy. / I made a doodie in my pants.

...And two large rhesus pizzas.  Thin crust, extra cheese. / Stop that, Diablo, you're going to get us in trouble. /  / Well, I was going to cook us puppies in creamy garlic sauce, but Phillip sez he's allergic to garlic. / Sorry, folks...'Goats' in no way endorses cruelty towards animals. /  / What do you mean there's no baby seal topping? / ...Except, of course, towards the ones we live with.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980604.html
Goats comic strip from June / 05 / 1998: animal abuse (2)
What's that? / It's a letter from the SPCA.  They're upset about the content of yesterday's strip. /  / Gee...did they object to the puppy references, or the baby seal stuff? / They want a public apology from Diablo. /  / This should be fun. / Yeah.  I bought some film.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980605.html
Goats comic strip from June / 07 / 1998: animal abuse (3)
Diablo, I think you should be careful at the SPCA convention.  You're not exactly their favorite chicken right now. / I don't think I have any worries, Phillip. /  / Look...I'm a chicken.  These people are animal lovers.  Think about it. /  / So, wait...you're a chicken...and they do what again? / Why dontcha take a break, Phillip.  We don't want you to hurt yourself.

Goats comic strip from June / 08 / 1998: animal abuse (4)
Is this the SPCA Convention?  I'm supposed to make a public apology for my insensitivity towards animals. / Yes, Mr. Diablo, we've been expecting you. /  / So, let me ask you, does my apology have to be completely sincere, or can it be peppered with sarcasm and meaningless gestures? / We prefer sincerity. /  / Well, how about if it's filled with general hate, loathing and derision? / Let's try again, shall we?

Goats comic strip from June / 09 / 1998: animal abuse (5)
Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to apologize for my cruelty towards animals.  But I first must say... / Psst.

Ladies and gentlemen of the SPCA, I'm here to apologize for my behavior towards animals.  But first, I have a dark, horrible secret to share with you all. /  / THWACK /  / Dammit, not again.  Who cut off Diablo's head? / And just when he was about to tell us his dark secret. / Ooh!  Save the entrails for me! / Who killed Diablo?  Stay tuned...

Goats comic strip from June / 11 / 1998: animal abuse (7)
I don't understand who would want to kill Diablo? / Pretty much everyone. / Never fear.  Phillip's here. /  / Clearly, this horrific deed was perpetrated by someone who wanted to protect themselves from the dark secret Diablo was about to reveal.  I will use my uncanny deductive skills to track down the killer. /  / An unnatural infatuation with Angela Lansbury doesn't qualify you for detective work. / I know.  That's why I have the hat and pipe, too.

My investigation into Diablo's murder has turned up a number of seedy, vicious criminal types, each with their own sick motives for whacking the chicken.  Send your leads to: tips@goats.com / Neil + Bob / Motive: Publicity stunt designed to drum up ticket sales for their roles in The X-Files Movie. / Lori / Motive: Jealous of Diablo's "Most Evil" status. / Jay / Motive: Neuronal decay after years of 'Busch Light Draft' abuse. / Howard / Motive: Mobility envy. / Jerrell / Motive: Enraged by mortal enemy Clint Howard's recently won "MTV Movie Award." / Gretchen / Motive: Chicken innards integral part of accordion worship ceremony.

I found Diablo's severed head. / And I think I found a clue as to who his killer is...this empty beer glass. /  / That's your beer glass, Phillip. / True.  But I also found this full bottle of beer. /  / That's your bottle, Phillip. / Yeah.  God, I love this detective stuff.

I know you had something to do with Diablo's murder, Jay.  I'll be watching you. / You ain't got nuthin' on me, Sherlock. /  / Not yet.  But bad people drink bad beer.  And so do you. / There's no such thing as a bad beer. /  / You've got me this time.  But don't expect your fancy logic to save you again. / I'll be sure to watch my step.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980615.html
Goats comic strip from June / 16 / 1998: animal abuse (11)
I still say Jay has something to do with Diablo's murder. / The only law he's broken is the German Beer Purity Law. /  / Well, then, The Eggplant is clearly the murderer.  / Phillip, The Eggplant doesn't even have arms. /  / Thalidomide, eh?  So you're saying The Eggplant has an accomplice? / I'm saying he's less of a murderer and more of a sandwich.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980616.html
Goats comic strip from June / 17 / 1998: animal abuse (12)
Hey, Lori, did you, by any chance, happen to murder Diablo? / No. /  /  / Are you sure? / I take it the investigation isn't going too smoothly.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980617.html
Goats comic strip from June / 18 / 1998: animal abuse (13)
Toothgnip, I can't seem to figure out who murdered Diablo. / Oh.  That was me. /  / Yes, Toothgnip, in a sense we're all responsible for Diablo's death. / I'm not speaking metaphorically.  I cut his @!?# head off. /  / The drugs...the women...we should have seen the signs.  We could have done something. / Like what?  Kill him again?
http://www.goats.com/archive/980618.html
Goats comic strip from June / 20 / 1998: animal abuse (14)
You didn't reall murder Diablo, did you, Toothgnip? / I sure did. /  / But it wasn't why you think.  Sure, he hogged the spotlight...sure, he took center stage in a feature named for me.  But all this is secondary to the real reason I killed him...because he discovered my secret. /  / Enough melodrama.  Just tell us already. / Well, I would if I weren't being interrupted by rude people.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980620.html
Goats comic strip from June / 21 / 1998: animal abuse (15)
If you really want to understand why I killed Diablo, we have to look for answers in my past, when I was still living with Thor, God of Thunder. /  / Thor kept two goats, Toothgrinder and Toothgnasher, who would pull his chariot.  I was their trainee. /  / Toothgrinder and Toothgnasher taught me much during our years together in Valhalla.  We were like family. / You've disappointed us yet again, Toothgnip. / Yeah.  You suck.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980621.html
Goats comic strip from June / 22 / 1998: animal abuse (16)
Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder taught me the ways of Asgard.  / So, what's the deal? / Well, basically, we just pull Thor around in a big cart.  And he occasionally eats us. /  / He eats you. / Well, yes.  But we regenerate.  It's a bit complicated. / Hollandaise sauce has special healing powers. /  / I quickly found out, however, that corporate policy didn't mesh well with my personality. / But we get the chicks right? Lotsa chicks? / No.  Not really. / Lotsa hollandaise sauce, tho.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980622.html
Goats comic strip from June / 23 / 1998: animal abuse (17)
I decided to discuss my dilemma with Thor. / I'm giving you two weeks notice, Thor. / Why? /  / Well, basically, I'm not happy with my benefits package. / Oh, c'mon.  We offer an employer-matching 401(k). /  / True, but my stock options don't vest for 5,000 years.  And you eat the employees. / Did I mention our 401(k)?
http://www.goats.com/archive/980623.html
Goats comic strip from June / 24 / 1998: animal abuse (18)
Thor and I parted on good terms. / Before you go, Toothgnip, I'd like to grant you one godly power...whatever you choose.  Something to give you an advantage in the mortal world. /  / How about the power to pick up women in bars? / Hmm.  A bit unorthodox, but okay. /  / Ooh...how about the power to make celebrities spontaneously implode using only my mind? / Don't push your luck.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980624.html
Goats comic strip from June / 25 / 1998: animal abuse (19)
Thor granted my wish. / Toothgnip, these are the Panties of Potency.  Wear these, and women will find you irresistable. /  / Panties. / Yes. /  / I suppose I'll have to wear the matching Brassiere of Badinage, too. / Do not mock the Panties of Potency.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980625.html
Goats comic strip from June / 28 / 1998: animal abuse (20)
As you already know, when I left Thor, I came to live with you two.  But I still hadn't tried out my new Panties of Potency.  A trip to the bar was in order. /  / I remained seated at the bar so the panties wouldn't be visible.  But would they work? /  / Yes. / Hello ladies.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980628.html
Goats comic strip from June / 29 / 1998: animal abuse (21)
For a year after Thor gave me the Panties of Potence, life was a dream - I hobnobbed with celebrities, dated starlets...It was too easy. /  / The only catch was thai I had to remain seated at all times, or someone might see the panties. /  / Silly me.  I always thought you sat all the time because Jon didn't know how to draw you any other way. / Shh.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980629.html
Goats comic strip from June / 30 / 1998: animal abuse (22)
Diablo slowly became suspicious of my Casanova-like behavior. / I don't get it.  How does Toothgnip get all those women? / Women make me nervous.  They give me an upset tummy. /  / I mean, I'm just as cute.  I'm definitely more active...Toothgnip just sits around all day.  What gives? / Sometimes, I don't have enough time to get to the potty. /  / By the Holy Groin of Lucifer, I swear I will get to the bottom of this! / But that's okay...I kinda like the squishy feeling it makes.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980630.html
Goats comic strip from July / 01 / 1998: animal abuse (23)
Diablo eventually confronted me about my strange behavior and unusual prowess. / Spill it, Toothgnip.  You're a sex machine to all the chicks.  How do you do it? / Hyper-pheromonal discharge.  It's a genetic disorder. /  / And pray tell, dear goat, why is it that we never see you stand? / Weak knees.  My parents used to beat me.  Tragic. /  / Something doesn't quite add up here...I swear to you I will find the truth. / Stress-induced narcolepsy.  Must go nap immediately.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980701.html
Goats comic strip from July / 02 / 1998: animal abuse (24)
A week later, Diablo walked in on me in the bathroom. /  / So, our resident Casanova wears frilly little panties, eh?  What else aren't you telling us, Toothgnip?  Next thing we know, you'll be sipping bulldyke nipplewhip lattes with George Michael. /  / I'm gonna sing this one to the rafters!  There won't be a man, woman, or domesticated animal on earth that won't know about your cross-dressing! / And with those words, Diablo's fate was sealed.
http://www.goats.com/archive/980702.html
Goats comic strip from July / 05 / 1998: animal abuse (25)
...So after Diablo discovered my secret, I had to kill him.  That's all. / What do you mean, "That's all"?  What kind of ending is that? /  / The kind that happened.  You saw Diablo get his head cut off. / Where are the plot twists?  The deception and intrigue?  I'm disappointed. /  / Alright, alright.  So, as I'm about to kill Diablo, I'm approached by two lesbian terrorists. / Were they beautiful?
http://www.goats.com/archive/980705.html
Goats comic strip from July / 06 / 1998: animal abuse (26)
I couldn't take the risk that Diablo would tell the world my secret.  That's why I had to kill him. / Of course, we both know your secret now. /  /  / Let's go to the pub.  All the beer you can drink, my treat. / I can be bought. / Hello Heifeweizen, goodbye long-term memory.

Having lost all my posessions to the soulless lawyers from United Features Syndicate (including my extensive sock collection), I'm somewhat sad today.  Thus, there will be no humor in today's episode of: / Real Geeks Don't... /  / Real Geeks don't get rejected by women... / Love me. / Never. /  / Well, actually...yes they do. / Oh, c'mon...just this once... / Unhand me, geek.

Hi Toothgnip. / Hi Diablo.  Didn't I kill you? /  / I am the phoenix, reborn. / No you're not.  You're a chicken who sewed his own head back on. /  / Do you have any idea how hard that is? / No, but perhaps we could arrange a demonstration.

Mr. Pet Dog and I were prancing through Farmer Woslowski's wheat fields, the moon above us pregnant with light.

Today, we'll be briefing you on our enemy, the Comics Board.  What little info we have was gathered for us by Bob, who has been on a secret recon mission. / Hey. /  / The origins of the Comics Board lie in the upcoming Gelatin Wars of 2034, which were the result of a very aggressive Jello marketing campaign. / Eat Jello or die. /  / As hunter-killer robots lay waste to the Northern Hemisphere, resistance groups searched for a way to fight.

...While the Jello Corporation's hunter-killer robots decimated the surface, resistance cells gathered beneath the rubble.  There, they perfected their weapon: tired party jokes. / "To get to the other side?"  I don't get it. /  / But the guerrilla tactics of the Resistance did not go unnoticed.  Executives at Jellocorp were quick to plan countermeasures. /  / You see, what we need, you see, is weasels.  Hyper-intelligent android weasels, you see. / Bill Cosby's hovering, evil brain

With the introduction of the Weasel 5000, the tides of the Jellocorp War of 2034 had turned.  The humor attacks of the Resistance were no longer effective.

C'mon, Diablo, give me the red pepper.  / You need the pepper, and I need control of the universe. /  / Perhaps we can arrange a trade.  I need a power base... A pedestal from which I can manipulate the minds of average Americans.  A way to warp their moral agendas and drain their intelligence.  /  / You want a daytime talk show? / And a bowl of ice cream.

What happened to your talk show, Diablo? / The guests are just far too bizarre.  I'm sticking to what I know best - ideology. /  / So what are you reading? / Karl Marx.  The man had some interesting ideas.  Listen to this - "Religion is the opiate of the masses." /  / Isn't opium the opiate of the masses? / Hey...you're right.  Jeez, it's a wonder that the Soviet Union didn't collapse sooner.

You see that woman at that table over there, Phillip?  She wants you.  You want her too, don't you? / Yes. /  / She likes men who throw lima beans at her, Phillip.  You should throw lima beans at her.  And set her cat on fire.  And serenade her with Jethro Tull's "Aqualung." / Aqualung. /  / Hey Phillip.

Phillip's been acting strangely. / And Steven Seagal likes little boys.

Goats comic strip from October / 15 / 1998: demonic posession (4)
Maybe Phillip's not responsible for his actions.  Maybe he's been posessed by an evil spirit, or a demon. /  / Look, I don't buy into that pseudo-religious claptrap.  For millenia, people have been blaming their shortcomings on external forces.  Ghouls.  Goblins.  Devils.  Well, it's time that these religious freaks took some responsibility for their actions. /  / Uh, hello?  Satanist here. / Oh, I'm sorry...did i upset your delicate sensibilities?

We can exorcise Phillip's demon by summoning a second demon to evict the first from his body. / How? /  / A simple potion.  Powdered bone, llama blood, and a touch of newt placenta. / Placenta. /  / My signature ingredient.  Nothing says "I love you" like placenta. / Tastes like chicken.

Goats comic strip from October / 19 / 1998: demonic posession (6)
So, this mixture will help us evict the demon from Phillip's body? / Just slip this into his drink.  He should become drowsy and relaxed. /  / And then what? / Dim the lights.  Compliment him on his dress.  Play some Manilow. /  / And then what? / Just do whatever comes naturally.  You're a big boy, Jon.  Haven't your parents talked to you about this?

I don't like it. / You want to help Phillip, don't you? /  / I don't think we're going to have to trick him. / Yeah, but tricking him into drinking your demon-potion seems a bit backhanded. /  / You can have this beer, Phillip, but it's going to cause demonic posession. / Yeah.  Whatever.  Beer.  Gimme.

Goats comic strip from October / 21 / 1998: demonic posession (8)
Don't drink it, Phillip.  You'll be posessed by a demon... a demon bent on eradicating me.  You don't want that, do you? / I... I can't help it... the beer... too powerful... /  / Don't do it!  For the love of God, no!!  Oh, what a world... what a world...  / GLUG / GLUG / GLUG / GLUG /  / Great.  A demon in the form of Mace Windu, Jedi Master, as protrayed by Samuel L.

Did it work?  Did our demon exorcise Phillip's other demon? / Too soon to tell. /  / Can you imagine what sort of epic battle must be going on in his mind?  He'll probably have an embolism from the psychic turbulence.  / One can only hope. /  / Do you have any threes? / Go fish.

Hey guys. / Phillip!  You're okay!  How do you feel? /  / Thirsty.  Where's my beer? / Any after-effects from your demonic posession? /  / "None at all.  I'm fine, guys." / None at all.  I'm fine, guys.

And you expect to meet intelligent women this way? / No.  I expect to meet mute, illiterate nymphs. /  / Jay, you are a disgusting, subhuman waste of skin. / And yet, you find me strangely alluring. /  / Much in the same way I find rectal bleeding alluring. / See?  We even have common interests.

It's not playful, Jay, it's hurtful.  You're damaging the self-esteem of those women. / If they didn't want it, they wouldn't dress like that. /  / You infuriating, misogynist, soulless bastard. / Hypocritical cock-tease.

Lori and Jay were kissing.  With their mouths. / Oh.  Well, good for them. /  / Doesn't it bother you that Jay's tongue was swishing around inside her mouth? / No... why should it? /  / To paraphrase George Michael, "He wants her sex...  he wants her love..." / Where do we keep the shake 'n' bake?

And you're okay with this? / What, that Jay and Lori were kissing?  Why wouldn't I be okay? /  / Because you have an unnatural obsession with her.  You're borderline psychotic. / Oh.  That. /  / Beer? / Sure... that would be an appropriately passive-agressive course of action.

You do realize that your little fling with Jay is killing Jon...  he's in severe denial. / That's half the fun. /  / But why Jay?  He's an oversexed neanderthal. / Not necessarily.

You're two hours late for dinner, Jay. / It's okay.  I already ate. /  / Well, it's too late to do anything now.  'Felicity' is on in fifteen minutes. / Ooh!  Sex!  What about sex? /  / Oh, I suppose that would be okay.  Can you make it quick? / There's no right answer to that, is there?

Jon, we need to talk. / Gah. /  / You're my friend, Jon, and I'm not blind to the pain my relationship with Lori has been causing you. / Gah? /  / That's why it's so difficult for me to tell you how absolutely, stunningly incredible she is in bed.  I'm sorry.  Really. / Gah.

Guys... I need your help.  / What can we do for you, Diablo?   /  / The bartender... the one they call Lori.  She must be eliminated. / Have you tried dropping a cow on her? /  / Of course.  But she saw right through my nefarious plot. / She's a cunning one. / I'll get more cows.

So, how are we going to get rid of Lori? / Here's the plan... first, we dress Bob up like a pirate. /  / Then, I will read her the lusty sonnets of Sylvia Plath until she swoons and yields to my every whim. /  / And how is this going to help our cause? / It won't.

Jon, Toothgnip keeps trying to touch my special area.  Make the bad man stop. / Like I would go near anything that smelled as much as decapitated hamsters as you do. /  / Can we put the top down?  It's freezing. /  / It's disgusting, Jon.  He's growing tumescent as we speak. / At least I'm not humping the back of the seat. / It's a chicken thing.  You wouldn't understand. /  / Amish Country / 346 mi. / Well, this trip is rapidly becoming a non-stop crap-o-rama. / Are we there yet, Jon? / Yes.  Get out.

Toast? / Oh yeah.  The spark plugs have been partially eaten, and there are beak-marks everywhere. /  / We're in the middle of nowhere.  What should we do? / Just wait, I guess.  It could be more than a week until we're rescued. /  / Say, on January 4? / Sounds about right.

Twas kind of you to pick up those boys at the side of the road, Ezekiel. / Ayuh. /  / They seem like decent folk. / Ayuh. /  / And if the injection takes hold quickly, we can grab their wallets. / Do they even use money? / I think they trade in pickles or eggs or something.

Thanks for letting us stay here, Ezekiel. / My pleasure...  Must be good to get away from all that city-stress, what with your ex-girlfriend getting engaged. /  / What?!  Huh? / Oh... I thought you knew.  Celia, your college sweetie, is getting married. /  / Why am I always the last one to hear about this sort of thing? / I heard from Zachariah's wife, down the way.

Goats comic strip from January / 11 / 1999: stalking the wild ex (2)
Celia and I were together for years... she guided me into manhood, much like a proctologist might guide an endoscope through a polyp-ridden duodenum.  And now, she's marrying some... some troglodyte. /  / Damn. / Ayuh... 'tis a shame.  She could be quite a wild mistress in the bedroom. /  / What? / Nothing.

I have to stop her. I have to get to Boston. / Jon, you haven't talked to Celia in years. Get on with your life. /  / Phillip, she's getting married. She can't! She said she'd be with me always. / Except for all that time since you graduated college, of course. /  / We're on a break. / A four-year break.
http://www.goats.com/archive/990112.html
Goats comic strip from January / 13 / 1999: stalking the wild ex (4)
But I do want Celia back.  Really I do. / Jon, you do remember why you're not with her anymore, right? /  / She kissed another boy. / The horror! / And do you remember what happened then? /  / I tried to kill Daisy Fuentes, Downtown Julie Brown, and Kennedy. / So it's safe to assume that your responses to stressful situations like these aren't entirely rational, yes?

Fine, already.  I won't go to Boston.  I won't try and stop my ex-girlfriend from getting married. / Good. / Good. / Good. /  / I'm just going to stay here and... uh... go over by the door... so I... uh... I can watch out for monkeys.  Attack monkeys.  That might attack us.  If I'm not by the door. /  / Snare traps? / Set up all along the perimiter. / Set up all along the perimeter. / Release the hounds.

I'm not going 'cause mommy told me to go look at business schools.  In Boston.  They have those in Boston, right? /  / How old are you? / Don't make me go back there.  If I have to watch "Teletubbies" one more time, I'll have an embolism.

...so I'm going to Boston to keep Celia from marrying a troglodyte. / Even though you haven't dated her for four years? /  / Well, um, that's technically accurate. / It seems to me that you focus on your "safe", failed relationship in an effort to avoid redirecting your energy towards establishing a potentially risky, new one. /  / All right, little girl, any more psychoanalysis from you and the bear dies. / No!  Don't hurt Teddy!
http://www.goats.com/archive/990120.html
Goats comic strip from January / 21 / 1999: stalking the wild ex (9)
It's pretty obvious, Jon.  You're purposely sabotaging your relationships because you're afraid they won't measure up to what you had with Celia, the archetype of all your future relationships. / No, I'm not. /  / Yes you are. / I said, No I'm not.  /  / Vehemently denying it doesn't make it any less true. / Yes it does.

So, uh... what's new?  How's medical school?  Get engaged lately? / Jonny, who's this adorable little girl? /  / Oh, her?  This is Emily.  She's... uh... I'm babysitting.  For Emily. / He kidnapped me and made me come to Boston. /  / God, I love kids. / And then he tried to kill my teddy bear. / I take it you've stopped your therapy, Jonny.

Goats comic strip from January / 26 / 1999: stalking the wild ex (12)
Celia... I... I'm here to tell you that you can't get married. / Oh?  And why not? /  / You know... because of that reason.  The one that escapes me at the moment. / This is endearing, Jonny, but the timing is awful. /  / You can't get married... because Emily is our child! / I am? / I'm pretty sure I would have remembered that.
http://www.goats.com/archive/990126.html
Goats comic strip from January / 27 / 1999: stalking the wild ex (13)
Please, Celia, don't get married. / This isn't the sort of thing you can fix with good manners, Jonny.  I'm marrying him because I love him. /  / Pretty please? / No, Jonny.  No.  I'm serious... you're making me uncomfortable. /  / How about 'pretty please' and $4.35... $4.40 in change? / Most of that is pocket lint, Jonny.

...and the Surgeon General is always saying how marriage is bad for you.  / My fiance is on his way home, Jonny.  You should probably be leaving.  /  / Don't marry him, Celia.  I... I still love you. / He's coming home from kickboxing lessons. /  / Well, look at the time. / It was great to see you again, Jonny.

...so she begged me to get back together with her, but I had to say no. / Uh-huh. /  / Well, you've done wonders with the bar while I was gone. / The construction crews finished last week. /  / What's with the human skulls over the restrooms? / Interior decoration by Diablo.

Going to Boston was such a waste. / You didn't miss much.

Great.  So Jerrell ate our hamsters.  What a waste of perfectly good rodents. / Not a complete waste... I think we've learned a valuable lesson. /  / And what lesson might that be? / Well, if you don't know, I'm not going to tell you. /  / Is this the "All supermodels should sleep with Bob" lesson we learned last time? / It's still valid.

They're mine. /  / Then why are they in quantum flux, alternating between states in several different planes of existence? / I like them that way.

So you don't find anything strange about the fact that enormous quantities of pudding cups have been appearing out of thin air. / Nope. /  / In your mind, there's nothing particularly ominous or foreboding about this. / Well, there's no tapioca. /  / God, I can smell the foreshadowing. / Right.

Hand over the pudding cup, Karlsson. / Get your own, freakish troglodyte. /  / That's not normal pudding, and you know it.  It's evil.  Put it down. / How can you attribute evil to something that tastes so good? /  / It's listed in the ingredients. / Whoa.  Right after riboflavin.

All I'm saying is that there's something disturbingly familiar about all this... evil... pudding... interdimensional flux... / I like pudding. /  / Wait a second... do you remember the time you invented a way to transport pudding electronically, and ended up in that alternate universe? / No. /  / You might want to refresh your memory.

So what you're saying is that someone from the evil, alternate dimension has recreated my experiments with the pudding transfer protocol, transporting pudding cups from there to our universe? /  / I knew you'd get it if I plied you with enough alcohol. / But why would someone do that?  And, more importantly, who? /  / I'll give you one guess, Karlsson... and it sure ain't Herve Villechaize.

Pudding is the only substance that is transdimensional by nature.  It can be used as a catalyst to transport other objects through dimensional rifts.  But it has to be 'tuned' to the universe it's interacting with.  Hence, evil pudding can be used as a transdimensional vehicle for the movement of evil-universe objects. /  / I don't follow. / In layman's terms, evil objects can use the energy of the pudding to get to places they couldn't on their own. /  / Oh!  Kinda like how Ed McMahon used Johnny Carson. / True.  But Ed doesn't taste quite as good.

So what are you gonna do with all this evil pudding, anyway? / Well, the details are somewhat complex, but it's your basic world-domination-type thing. /  / You know, maybe it's just the pudding talking, but there's something different about you, Jon... / Give me some sugar, baby. /  / He's kissing her!?? / Amongst other things.

If Evil Jon wants to take over the world, that's one thing... but to seduce Lori by pretending to be me is unacceptable.  We're going to have to fight evil with evil. / Why don't we fight evil with parsnips? /  / Because that's stupid. / Not as stupid as you may think.  The parsnip was invented by Edward Parsnip in 1953 as a response to the encroachment of communism in eastern Europe.  The parsnip remains one of our primary weapons in the "Cold War" of today. /  / And I imagine this has some relevance to our situation. / Nah.  I just like to say "parsnip." / Man...

I can't believe you have the guts to show your face in here, Diablo. / Where I come from, we call them cahones.  Come and get some, baby. /  / Aw hell. /  / You're dead, chicken. / It's been a pleasure doing business with you.

Hi.  Evil Jon, I presume?  / Ah, Diablo.  I'd wondered when you'd show up. /  / Yeah.  Lori's under a cow. / Just as well.  I was beginning to chafe. /  / I have more cows.  Wanna see? / Anti-cow device.  Don't bother.

So... what's it like in the evil alternate universe? / Constant sex.  Power.  Money.  Beer.  A bit of a nuisance, actually. /  / Do you get to dominate the peons?  Is there cruelty? / All you can eat. /  / Sounds dreamy.  Like "Tiger Beat" for satanic chickens. / I have a subscription.

With these evil Brooke Shields clones at my command... these efficient, single-minded killing machines... I will soon hold dominion over this realm.  / Is Andre here yet?  What's my motivation? / Rar.  / Do I have time to purge before the next sene? /  / And so, Evil Jon learns what the rest of us already knew: no matter what the dimension, evil or good, Brooke Shields is a talentless, useless, vapid waste of skin. / C'mon.  Ice cream's on me.

...and, as Evil Jon returned to the Bizzaro Universe, sullen and defeated, things began to return to normal... / I'll be back. /  / ...attempts to return our heroes to their normal sizes were met with success, if not some resistance... / Back off.  I'm in Marlboro Country. /  / ...and bovine-removal procedures... um... proceeded.  / Why would people throw away a perfectly good cow? / Dude.  Score.

Excellent.  Thanks to my forethought and our VCR, we'll still be able to watch Dick Clark's Time Change Rockin' Eve once we get home from the bar tonight. /  / Oh no. / What? /  /  / Did you set the clock on the VCR forward? / Damn you, Dick Clark.  Damn you to hell!!!

So?  Did it record? / Nope.  But we did manage to get the second hour of "Full House: a Retrospective." /  / You know what we have to do now. / Watch the adorable antics of the Olsen twins? /  / Nope.

You want to raise cows. In our apartment. / Not just any cows. Kobe beef cows. /  / Kobe beef is a delicacy... the price people pay for the stuff is astronomical. And the best part is that the raising of the cattle involves sake massages and the feeding of massive quantities of beer. /  / You do realize that the cows get the beer and massages, not give them.  / Oh. Are you sure?

I can't believe Gertie is gone.  I've been rejected by a cow. / Bummer. /  / A cow, Diablo.  I didn't meet the standards of a methane-emitting food animal with the learning potential of a post-accident Gary Busey.  How pitiful am I? / Way down there. /  / I... I feel like Jon. / Oh, c'mon.

Where's the cow?  Where is the beast? / We heard you had a cow. /  / She's gone.  Left for greener pastures. / Gone?  It's gone? / Aw hell.  What do we do now? /  / What's that thing? / Um... nothing. / If I don't mutilate something soon, I'm gonna freak.  Are there any obese people here?

Goats comic strip from April / 19 / 1999: cows and e-commerce (10)
I'm not surprised your cow ran off.  This business plan is a mess.  / It's a solid, brilliant plan.  Raising kobe beef is very profitable. /  / You have no clear source of revenue.  You've already spent your projected profits on beer.  And your entire adverstising budget is devoted to attacking Tara Lipinski with a crowbar to get your name in the paper. / Sounds like success to me. /  / There's also this small bit where the cow gets eaten by Japanese businessmen. / If Gertie had a problem with that, she only had to say something to me.

Goats comic strip from April / 20 / 1999: cows and e-commerce (11)
So, how do we modify this business plan to make it work? / Ooh... I'll get a bunch of Bonobo monkeys for the apartment.  We can watch them have sex. /  / Bonobo monkeys. / Yeah.  It'll be like the Playboy Channel.  Except with monkeys.  /  / It must be difficult being such a visionary. / Not really.  You just have to drink a whole lot.

Goats comic strip from April / 21 / 1999: cows and e-commerce (12)
Now, working under the premise that watching monkeys have sex is a less-than-ideal way for any business to make a profit, let's continue. /  / The most successful businesses, at least in terms of making suckers out of the public, have been internet companies.  How can we use the internet to make our business profitable? /  / Cow porn? / I was thinking "e-commerce," but let's not dismiss your idea outright.
http://www.goats.com/archive/990421.html
Goats comic strip from April / 22 / 1999: cows and e-commerce (13)
So you want to sell cows over the internet. / Not necessarily cows... we can sell anything.  Preferably something that people will buy. /  / Monkeys! / No.  Not monkeys.  We need to think of something that lends itself to e-commerce the way that books and software do. /  / Pre-moistened towelettes! / Now we're cookin' with gas.

Goats comic strip from April / 23 / 1999: cows and e-commerce (14)
How goes our little e-commerce venture? / I've bought a carton of moistened towelettes, and registered the "moistnap.com" domain.  What else do we need? /  / Maybe a chat room, so the moistnappies can talk amongst themselves. / Not bad.  How about web-based email, too? /  / Oh!  And a Reuters newsfeed.  And a homepage builder! / Good idea.  Man, we are so bleeding-edge.

Check out our new slogan. / "Moistnap.com: The premier community portal destination site for moistened towelette users." /  / I know, I know, it's brilliant, but a snappy slogan isn't going to rake in the money by itself.  We need to come up with a way to push the moistened towelettes... a way to make them... you know, sexy. /  / I could rub them against my naked thighs. / A pint of NyQuil isn't going to get me to sleep tonight.

Shouldn't you be doing the programming for the Moistnap.com site? / Nah.  I've got Jerrell doing most of the harder stuff. /  / We don't have any operating capital.  How do you expect to pay him? / I'm paying him with... get this... stock options. /  / HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA / HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA / HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA /  /  / HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA / HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA / HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Your talk about stock options yesterday got me thinking... so I've taken Moistnap.com public. / We had an IPO? /  / Yup.  Shares rocketed up from an initial price of $3.50, opening at $160.00.

NY 1 / Keith Shellac, Reporter / We're here today with Phillip and Diablo, wunderkind founders of the wildly successful Moistnap.com moistened towelette community website, which successfully stunned Wall Street by pulling off the most successful IPO ever for a moistened products company. /  / Hello, gentlemen.  We've all heard stories of how you started out, serving web pages off of pocket calculators from your college dorm room, fighting off larger competitors like Towelsoft with silverware stolen from the dining halls.  And now, 4 years later, an IPO. /  / To what do you attribute your success? / I think it's due to the fact that we're not only "young," but "hip" as well. / And evil.  Very, very evil.

So we're stinking rich now, right? / Not exactly.  Your money is locked up in stock, and there's a six-month moratorium on stock sales by company principles. /  / But we can sell our shares after that, right? / Nope.

You know, Jon, you haven't had an existential crisis in well over a month. What's wrong? / Nothing's wrong. /  / It's just that I've given up. Given up trying to find someone who understands me, given up tempting fate to do nasty, cruel things to me, given up trying to fight the system and make something of my life.

Clearly, the universe has something against me. A master plan to keep me in a constant state of dashed hopes and despair. I can't bear the loneliness for much longer. How do you deal with it, Phillip? /  / I don't. I have a girlfriend. / What, you went out and bought yourself an inflatable playmate? /  / Actually, we've been together for over a year. You're just too self-absorbed to notice.  / Does she have friends?

I can't believe Phillip has a girlfriend.  What sort of warped mind could find him attractive? / My friend Lauren. /  / You knew about this? / Yes.  I set them up. /  / And she actually dates him?  Is she a lobotomite?  Can you get any more of them?  I'm not picky. / Really.

I think it's pretty clear that you've invented this woman solely to irritate me. / Prove it. /  / You can't expect me to give you a mathematical proof that your imaginary friend is actually imaginary. / If you can't prove that she doesn't exist, simple deduction shows that she does exist. /  / I swear, if Plato was here right now, he'd kick your ass. / Prove it.

You two make an... um... interesting couple.  How did you meet? / Well, it's a really romantic story, actually. /  / I was standing over at the other end of the bar, talking to Lynda, when Phillip came over and asked if he could buy me a drink.  I said okay, and he pulled a pint glass of some colorless, odorless, tasteless liquid out of his pants. /  / That's, um... that's his way of saying he likes you. / Strange... I...

Lauren, we realize that being introduced to all of Phillip's friends might be a bit... traumatic for you. So we'd like to welcome you to our little family with a small ceremony we reserve for special occasions. /  / First, you must put on the blindfold of trust. / This is adorable.

Toothgnip and Diablo have your girlfriend tied up and oiled down. / I must drink beer. / Beer is the mind-killer. Beer is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my beer. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see it's path.  / When the beer has gone there will be nothing.

Jon says you've captured my girlfriend. / Just a little. She's lots of fun to play with. /  / Look... if it was up to me, you could tie her up any which way but loose. It builds character. But if you make her angry, she's not going to let me come down to the bar to hang out with you guys anymore. /  / So... you're saying it's a potential Yoko situation. / And Ringo's not going to be around to bail us out this time.

Well, we've successfully resolved another storyline. Phillip gets to keep his girlfriend, Toothgnip gets to sleep with those Japanese stewardesses, and I stole the kidneys out of several sleeping lawyers. /  / What do you mean, resolved? Nothing's been resolved. I'm still depressed and lonely and without any hope for the future. /  / Oh!

She said she'd be with me always.  Now, I don't even know her last name.  I haven't said a thing.  You, on the other hand, have a loving girlfriend and a multi-million dollar internet company, but can't stop complaining about some stupid movie.  Gah. /  / What's up his ass? / Damned if I know.

To fully explain to you what I have in mind to win the brewing contest, we'll need to go back to a dark time in my youth, shortly after the media spectacle following my expulsion from Harvard business school, which I'm sure you've all heard about.  /  / After a failed stint as a prostitute in Amsterdam's red light district, I was working my way through Europe, picking grapes in Epernay, France.  My mentor in the fields was a wizened, one-eyed quadruple amputee named Shazam Twix.  Twix taught me many things, such as how to hypnotize a squirrel with a pair of Ben-wa balls. /  / What a load of crap.

In addition to the tricks with the squirrels, Shazam Twix also introduced me to a lot of other things out in the vineyards of Epernay. The days were long, and we killed a lot of hours with long games of bocce under the influence of "alternative" drugs. Twix was an exceptional player aided by the strength of his robotic limbs.  /  / One day, after a particularly grueling bocce match played whilst strung out on free-based lemon merangue, we stumbled into town to flirt with the champagne cellar tour guides, who were renowned for their lax morals and talented fingers. Strangely, many of them had unnatural attachments to their pet ferrets... /  / ...or as they would call them, "ferrets". But I digress. / Couldn't tell.

Usually, Twix would scare off the tour guides with his drug-induced ideological rants, shouting about how the purity of bocce was being undermined by the Socialist state, and how only Government-sanctioned, institutionalized worship of the sport would ever restore it to its previous holy status. /  / On the other hand, I was as smooth with the ladies as a newly-shorn sheep covered in baby oil. They would often take me on private tours of the cellars, pointing out hidden passageways where they would often take long, luxurious, lascivious lunches with their pet ferrets. /  / One night, long after the riddlers had gone home and Twix had passed out after a particularly frenzied merengue high, the most morally challenged of the guides, Saffron, invited me down into the cellar to explore the hidden tunnels with her.

Saffron and I took our seats in the stands, careful not to miss any of the action in the ring below.  I flagged down one of the wandering concession men and bought her some milk duds.  "I have something to tell you," she whispered, running her hand across my thigh.  /  / Just then, Mendel dealt Samsa a devastating Punnett Square Power Punch!  The cowardly insect scurried off to find refuge under a nearby giant refrigerator.  /  / I turned back to Saffron to finish our conversation, but she had passed out from the excitement and a milk dud overdoes.  The caramel-and-chocolate goodness had been too much for her to bear.  I went off in search of Mendel, determined to get his autograph.

I pushed my way past the crowd of paparazzi gathered outside of Mendel's dressing room, slipping the guard $50 to gain entrance to the inner sanctum. Mendel sat inside, relaxing in a smoking jacket with a bowl of split-pea soup at his side.  /  / He invited me to sit down, offering me a bowl of my own. We chatted for hours, discussing the distribution of recessive yellow flower alleles and his new-found success as a wrestler over a hundred years after his death.  /    /  / Mendel's Laboratory Keys. / We parted as friends, with plans to meet the next day for dim sum. Little did he know that I had other plans... plans involving the key I had lifted from the pocket of his smoking jacket.

I bade my time, hiding out in the champagne cellar tunnels until the spectators, and Mendel, had gone home for the evening. When the time was right, I crept back into Mendel's dressing room and found the door to his secret laboratory. /  / The darkened lab stood before me, bunsen burners and erlenmeyer flasks bathed in the shadows of scientific discovery. Two hundred years of genetic research and innovation would soon be mine. I popped a "mentos". /  / But before I could go any further, I felt a sharp pain at the base of my neck as a giant mutant pea plant brought down the cold steel of a monkey wrench on my head. The world swam and went black.

I awoke to find myself chained to a wall of Mendel's laboratory.  Mendel himself stood before me, accompanied by a small army of his vicious, hyperintelligent pea plants. /  / "Diablo," he chuckled, "I was worried for you when you didn't show for dim sum today.  A shame, really.  I had so looked forward to eating pork buns and sticky balls with you." /  / Pork buns. / Yeah.  It's hard to sound menacing when you're talking about dim sum. / "I will destroy you with my deadly shrimp balls."

Mendel giggled maniacally, stroking his hands as if they were naughty, naughty hamsters that had stayed out past their curfew.  "I'm so sorry, Mr. Diablo, but you'll understand that I can't let you leave here alive, knowing what you do." /  / As his pea-plant henchmen closed in on me, xylem and phloem pulsing with the knowledge that they would be having kung pao chicken for dinner, I prayed for a contrived plot twist to free me from my predicament. /  / Just as their greasy tentacles were about to close my eyes forever, Shazam Twix burst through the wall beside me with his powerful robotic arms!  High as a kite, his nostrils encrusted with the residue of a dozen pixie stix, he began to shout irrationally.  "Deus ex machina!!"

Shazam Twix began frantically lobbing bocce balls around the lab, whacking the monstrous pea plants in what would have been their heads if pea plants had heads.  His powerful robotic arms worked furiously, disabling the attackers as they approached. /  / Twix activated a timed explosive bocce ball and rolled it into the heart of Mendel's lair.  We ran for the exit, shouting rude and demeaning epithets in a variety of dead languages, evading the few remaining plants as they grabbed at us.  I popped another "Mentos." /  / We leapt free of the lab just as the tremendous fireball engulfed it.  Miraculously unharmed, Twix turned to me and said, "Marry me, baby."  "You bet," I replied.  We embraced as the credits rolled.

We were somewhere around Newark on the edge of the desert when the Pop-Tarts began to take hold.  I remember saying something like, "I feel a bit tasty. yet morally ambiguous..."  And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us... / and the sky was full of what looked like huge kittens, all swooping and purring and playing with yarn around the car, which was going about a hundred miles and hour with the top down to Atlantic City.

Hi, I'm Tommy, owner of pub.  Tell me little bit about yourself. / I really like condiments. /  / No, no.

Hellmann's Dijonnaise Creamy Mustard is a mustard that has a smooth Dijon taste in a deliciously creamy mustard.*  / *from Hellmann's.com

And you are? / I'm Stephanie, and this is Siobain. We're here for the bartending job. /  / You not obsessed with condiments or accordions? / Not really. Is that a requirement? / Sometimes I put ketchup on my fries. /  / Wonderful. You hired. / So actual skills aren't a prerequisite? / I can get some ketchup if you'd like.

Unfortunately, we can't hire both of you.  We have creamed-corn wrestle match to decide. / What? /  / Both dress in skimpy bikini and wrestle in creamed corn.  Winner gets job. / I have my lawyer on speed-dial. /  / Oh, just kidding.  We have sense of humor at pub.  You both get job. / That's what I thought. / I only have a one-piece suit with me.  Is that okay?

Novice bar-wench! Bow down before me, for I am your dark lord and servant of Satan. Kneel, and pay homage to the forces of evil. /  / Ah. You must be Diablo. / What black magic do you possess that would reveal my name to you? /  / Lynda told me to watch out for... um... the most handsome chicken in the bar. / Ah. Well. But of course. Carry on.

What does it take to get a glass of beer in this place? / You know, it's customary to buy your new bartender a shot now and then to ensure good service. /  /  / Deal. / And I'll just put this bottle of Jack Daniels on your tab to ensure that I remember to put beer in that glass.

I don't know, Siobain... why are we taking another bartending job? / Because we have no marketable skills, and it pays our rent. /  / Speak for yourself. I just can't stand the thought of dealing with yet another bar full of psychos. / Give 'em a chance, Steph. They don't seem too bad. /  / The brunette is cute. I wonder if she'd mind if I stalked her. / I bet her address is in her purse. / I get her makeup when you're done.

Y'Know, the beer list here isn't nearly as complete as the one where I used to work. / Really? What's missing? /  / Well, for one, I'm not seeing "Uncle Disgusting's Spider Brew". You can't really call yourself a beer drinker unless you've tried it. / Blasphemy! Heretic! /  / Fine... Suit yourself. / I'll give you a billion dollars for an Uncle Disgusting's Spider Brew.

What do you mean, you don't have any? / Well, Uncle Disgusting's Spider Brew is only available in a small province of northern England.  The spiders don't deal well with international travel. /  / jon!  Call the travel agent! / That's the spirit!  Go get 'em, tiger. /  / They sell Spider Brew at the corner deli.

...and if you haven't had an Uncle Disgusting's Spider Brew, you're not really considered to be a beer drinker. / So? /  / So, we need to go to England to get some. / I'm not flying to England just so you can assuage your fears about not being in some mythical fraternity of beer drinkers. /  / Spider Brew, uh... also makes you attractive to women.  English women.  They did science-type testing. / How many carry-on pieces am I allowed?

Goats comic strip from December / 02 / 1999: uncle disgusting's spider brew (4)
The beer really makes you attractive to women?  How? / Oh, sure.  But it's a complex process, hard to explain.  It uses science and stuff. /  / Must be some sort of arachnid pheromone. / Sure.  Yah.  Where's the stewardess? /  / I mean, does it make you physically more attractive, or is it an understated sort of thing? / More scotch, sir? / Just leave the bottle.

...and the brunette!  She's... oh, she's just so much woman!  Gah! / I don't mean to be obsessive, but I am.  Where's my Spider Brew? /  / You're not looking at the big picture, Phillip.  There's more to be had here than beer. / You're right... they'll be perfect pawns in my bid to conquer their puny country. /  / Ooh!  This one's nice... but I so adore this other one... / By the time we're done with the Americans and their wallets, you'll own the entire set.

jon, what are you doing sleeping here on the couch? / I decided to give Phillip the bed. /  / Was there a problem with the accomodations? / No, Holly, no... I just wanted to make sure he got a good night's sleep. /  / Really?  That's so considerate of you. / Well, that, and he's got this "explosive drooling" problem when he sleeps.

Gah. /  / Maybe Jon's friend is single. / I may be single now, but I'm not a desperate psychotic. / Flattery will get you nowhere, m'dear.

We'll be back later.  I left some snacks in the kitchen for you. / And Phillip, try not to set anything on fire. /  / So.  Um.  Hi. / Do you have any pets?  /  / I... uh... I used to have some fish.  Why? / Oh.  Hmph.  Guess I brought that jellied gasoline for nothing.

Holly, I know we've only known each other a short time, but I have something to ask you. / Um... okay. /  / Do you see this relationship having any kind of future? / Oh... gosh.  I... yeah, why not?  Sure.  Why do you ask? /  / Because a sentient Satan-worshipping chicken is en route on a mission to destroy our love. / Can I reconsider my previous answer?

I can't believe you called Diablo!  Why would you do that? / Let me explain.  Did you know that Billy Corgan used to be on "Small Wonder"?  /  / What does that have to do with anything? / Nothing.  But it did help distract you for a moment. /  / I just flew in from the States, and boy, are my wings tired. / AGH!  GAH!  BLERG!! / No wonder Holly finds you attractive.  You're so articulate.

40 cases of "Tastes like chicken" candy bars. / They're for my Y2K love bunker. /  / Love bunker. / Yah. I'm going to hole up with a few victoria's secret models until the apocalypse is over. /  / and you expect victoria's secret models to subsist on candy bars. / Of course not. I have a delivery menu from "Seoul Man" korean food.

Whoa! Who bought the candy bars? / You can thank Toothgnip. They're for his Y2K love bunker. /  / They've combined my two favorite taste sensations - Chicken and sugar! / They don't actually taste like chicken. It's just a clever marketing gimmick. /  / But... but it says "tastes like chicken." It says so. / It's a misnomer. It's like that time that you went to "Nobody Beats the Wiz" in leather chaps, shouting for Michael Jackson to "take it like a man".

Do you think Toothgnip will let me crash in his Y2K Love Bunker? / Why would you want to?  This whole Y2K nonsense is overblown. /  / I can bring my "Gamera vs. Llamatron" video.  Everyone loves Gamera. / Where is he going to build a bunker in Manhattan, anyway?  /  / HEY!  What the fuck is going on!?! / Sorry.  Would you guys mind moving to the left?

Where's that draft coming from? / The huge hole Toothgnip put in the floor. / I think it's festive. /  / Nothing like a big hole in the floor to spice up Christmas. / That makes absolutely no sense. / Sure it does.  You just don't understand Chirstmas, is all. /  / Yeah.  Santa hates you 'cause you're Jewish. / Shut up. / I worship Satan, and Santa likes me better than you.

I need to be absolutely sure that the Panties of Potency are Y2K-compliant. / Well, it should be easy enough to check.  We just have to set the date forward to January 1. /  /  / The user interface isn't exactly what I'd call intuitive. / Is there a support number we can call?

They want me to press '12' for customer support.  Damned if I can find the '12' button. / Maybe they have support info on their website. /  / I don't know, Toothgnip.  Seems to me that maybe it's time you cast off this albatross from around your neck, these damnable Panties of Potency.  Maybe you don't even need them.  Maybe women like you, not for your lingerie, but for who you are... who you are in your heart. /  / I have a crate of grenades. / Maybe I can press '1' and '2' at the same time.

Apparently, panties aren't affected by the Y2K bug. / Let me see that. /  / Apparently, they're made from some strange material called "cotton," which, I assume, precludes the need for a CPU. / Must be a typo.
