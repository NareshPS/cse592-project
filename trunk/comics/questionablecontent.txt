PANEL 1 / Faye: You're sure it's okay that I stay here? I really hate to impose on you. / Marten: Don't worry about it.  It's the least I can do. / PANEL 2 / Faye: Heh, my mom would completely lose her shit if she found out I was staying with some boy. / Marten: Better not let her find out then. / PANEL 3 / Marten: What are you doing? / PANEL 4 / Faye: Calling my mom. Sending her into fits of hysterics is my little way of saying "I love you." / Marten: Just don't give her my address.  I don't want her breaking in and murdering me in my sleep.

Guest Strip Extravanga: Knights of the Old Do It Your Fucking Self
PANEL 1 / Marten: Is it just me, or is KotOR a tad overrated? / Steve: How do you mean? / PANEL 2 / Marten: Don't get me wrong - strutting around the galaxy with a lightsaber in each hand is about as pimp as it gets / Steve: Did you just say "pimp"? / Marten: - it's just that everywhere I go people want me to help them with something. / Steve: That's true. / PANEL 3 / Martin: I just feel like, "find your own goddamn ewok shoes, I've got a galaxy to save and/or destroy!" / Pintsize: [Instruction]: Do not under-estimate the power of the DarkSide, meat-bag. / PANEL 4 / Steve: Sorry, what was that? / Pintsize: Nothing.

25 : The Look Of Doom
PANEL 1 / Faye: Like my new haircut? / Marten: Looks nice. I was wondering where you ran off to. / PANEL 2 / Marten: As for sleeping arrangements, you can have my bed. I'll sleep on the couch. / Faye: No way! You sleep in your bed. I'm being intrusive enough already. / Marten: It's no probem, really. You take the bed. / PANEL 3 / Pintsize: Why don't you two just share the bed? / PANEL 4 / [[Faye glares at Marten. Marten gives chagrined smile.]] / PANEL 5 / Marten: Wait for her to blink, then make a run for it. / Pintsize: Affirmative.

Number Twenty-Six: Dress Code
PANEL 1 / Faye: So is it just me, or is the concept of "indie cred" completely retarded? / Marten: I know what you mean. / PANEL 2 / Marten: Why should it matter how popular my favorite band is, or whether I bought my jeans at The Gap or the Salvation Army? / PANEL 3 / Faye: You buy clothes from The Gap? / PANEL 4 / Marten: Don't you smirk at me.  I saw the Express Jeans tag sticking up from the back of your trousers. / Faye: Ah ha! I KNEW you've been secretly peeking at my bottom!

Number Twenty-Seven: No Love For The Emo
PANEL 1 / Faye: So if you could beat up any emo band, who would you beat up? / Marten: Oh, definitely the dude from Dashboard Confessional. He seriously needs to stop whining about how some girl dumped him. / PANEL 2 / Marten:  I'd also kick Jeremy Enigk's ass for making every Sunny Day Real Estate album since Diary. They should have just stopped then. / Faye: Seriously! You got it right, guys. Stop trying! / PANEL 3 / Faye:  I'd assault From Autumn To Ashes for having the most stereotypically bad emo band name ever. / Marten:  Hehe. From Autumn To Beatings! / PANEL 4 / Faye:  I would also totally kick Cono Oberst's ass just for having that ridiculous hairdo. / Marten:  Is he the dude from Bright Eyes? I always confuse him with Winona Ryder.

Number Twenty-Eight: Drama!
PANEL 1 / Faye: Thanks again for letting me stay at your place, Marten. / Marten: It's no problem, you can stay as long as you want. / PANEL 2 / Marten: So I'll meet you here at 5:30 and then we'll go grab some dinner, ok? / Faye: Sounds great! / PANEL 3 / Sara: Had a busy weekend, eh? / Faye: Oh man, you have NO idea.  That was the boy I was telling you about the other day! / PANEL 4 / Faye: And judging by your icy glare, he also happens to be the boy you've been lusting after for the past few weeks. / Sara: Bingo. / Faye: Shit. / Sara: Bingo again.

Number Twenty-Nine: Only Sort Of Relieved
PANEL 1 / Sara: I can't believe my luck. It figures that the one boy I have the hots for would be seduced by a coworker. / Faye: Sara, listen to me. I didn't seduce him. / PANEL 2 / Faye: My apartment BURNED DOWN. I'm staying at his place becase I have nowhere else to go and he was kind enough to offer me his couch to sleep on. It's completely platonic. / PANEL 3 / Sara:

Number Thirty: Sudden Realizations
PANEL 1 / Sara: Marten? Hi, my name's Sara. I just wanted to get something off my chest. / PANEL 2: / Sara: I've had a crush on you ever since you started coming in here. I was going to finally ask you out tonight, but I was thinking about it today and I realized something. It's not you as a PERSON that I've got a crush on, but the abstract concept of a "cute indie boy" that you represent. / Sara: It wouldn't be fair to hold you to some impossible standard, so I think it's best if I don't go out with you after all. / PANEL 3: / Sara: I wanted to thank you for helping me realize this. I feel a lot better now, about myself and about everything. Thank you. / PANEL 4: / Marten: What the fuck? / Faye: You almost had a date! But you got dumped at the last minute in favor of an epiphany.

Number Thirty-One: I Hate It When They Giggle
PANEL 1 / Steve: I fucking hate these stupid adhesive seals they put on CDs. / PANEL 2 / Marten: I dunno, I kinda like them. / Steve: Why? / PANEL 3 / Marten: Expending all the effort to get the seal off makes the music that much more enjoyable once you finally get the CD out of the jewel case. / PANEL 4 / Steve: Kind of like taking off a girl's bra? / Marten: Yeah, except CDs don't start giggling if it takes you more than fifteen seconds.

32: Psychic Powers
PANEL 1 / Steve: So she had a crush on you, but changed her mind because she thinks she's only attracted to your image? / Marten: Apparently. / PANEL 2 / Steve: That's harsh. / Marten: Mmmyep. / PANEL 3 / [[Marten looks supiciously at Steve while Steve tries to act innocent]] / PANEL 4 / Marten: You're thinking of asking her out, aren't you. / Steve: Who, me?

I could hear you all the way outside! / Faye: This little PERV walked in on me while I was changing! / PANEL 2 / Faye: If it happens again I will visit destruction upon you.  With a hammer. / Pintsize: I did not mean to see her breasts, it was an accident! / PANEL 3 / [[Both stare forward blankly.]] / PANEL 4 / Marten: ...So? / Pintsize: They were firm, yet supple, with perky nipples and just the right amount of jiggling. / Marten: Awesome.

Number Thirty-Four: The Worst Kind Of Horse
PANEL 1 / Faye: Hey, are you ok? / Marten: Hmm? I'm all right I guess. / PANEL 2 / Faye: Still down about that whole Sara thing? / Marten: A little, yeah. / PANEL 3 / Faye: Look at it this way - everything happens for a reason. Maybe by not going out with her you spared yourself from some misery further down the line! / Marten: Heh, yeah. Like if she turned out to have herpes or something / PANEL 4 / Faye: Maybe she gives horrible blowjobs, or has uncontrollable flatulence! / Marten: She collects Hitler memorabilia and had sex with a horse! / Faye: A Nazi horse!

PANEL 1 / Faye: Hey Marten, do you have any painkillers? I'm cramping up something awful today. / Marten: Time of the month? / Faye: Yeah. / PANEL 2 / Marten: That must really suck. / Faye: Oh, you have NO idea.  The worst part is how horny I get due to all the extra hormones. / PANEL 3 / [[Marten tries to look innocent]] / PANEL 4 / Marten: A lesser man, a man weaker than I, might injerject with a lewd or suggestive comment at this juncture. / Faye: I am glad that such a foolish man is not around, for I would surely defenestrate him with great rapidity.

Number Thirty-Seven: Misery Loves Booze
Panel 1 / Jim: So why is it y'all "indie kids" or whatever ya call yerselves shop at the Salvation Army an' drink in dive bars like this one? Y'all went to college, ya ain't workin' construction like me. What gives? / Panel 2  / Marten: How much money do you make per year? / Jim: 'Bout thirty K, why ya askin'? / Panel 3 / Marten: I make barely twenty thousand dollars a year. I have thousands of dollars in student loans to pay off, and I can barely afford to pay my rent each month and still buy food. I hate my job, but because of this shitty economy, I can't afford to quit and find a job I actually like. / Panel 3 / Jim: Well shit, buddy, next round's on me then. / Marten: Cool. I'll go put some Johnny Cash on the jukebox.

Panel 1 / Marten: Faye! I was wondering when you'd show up! / Faye: Judging by the smell, one of us has been drinking hard liquor, and it is not me. / Panel 2 / Marten: Hey Jim! This is Faye, that girl I was telling you about. / Jim: Well shee-hit if'n you ain't the finest lookin' thang I seen all day! / Panel 3 / Faye: Okay, let me get this straight. You've been in here getting drunk for the past hour in the company of some random redneck? / Marten: Pretty much, yeah. / Panel 4 / Faye: Sounds like fun. Now buy me a shot of whatever hell-brew you two have been drinking and let's get this party started. / Marten: Perhaps not the wisest decision, but a good decision nonetheless! / Jim: Where I come from, we just shorten that sentence to "woo!"

Number Thirty-Nine: That Special Time Of Year
PANEL 1 / Faye: Why do webcomics make such a big deal of Halloween, anyway? / Marten: I think there are a couple different reasons. / PANEL 2 / Marten: A lot of the artists probably just enjoy drawing their characters in different costumes and stuff. / PANEL 3 / Marten: Also, readers seem to have a really good time trying to figure out who each character is dressed up as. / PANEL 4 / Marten: Wow, Pintsize.  That is an amazing Red Robot costume. / Red Robot: WHO IS THIS PINTSIZE?  I WILL CRUSH THE IMPOSTOR!

Mwa ha ha ha!
http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=41
Number Forty-Two: Not Sexy After All?
PANEL 1 / Faye: Rmmffggh. / Marten: I was wondering when you'd wake up. / PANEL 2 / Faye: Did I make an ass of myself last night? I don't remember anything past coming home. / Marten: No, but you did say that you thought MY ass was pretty cute. / PANEL 3 / [[Faye looks at Marten]] / PANEL 4 / Faye: Drink will make a girl say ridiculous things. / Marten: I suppose that would also explain your subsequent monologue about using quantum physics and burnt toast to achieve immortality.

Number Forty-Three: I'm Going Off the Rails
PANEL 1 / Marten: I wish I had the money to buy an iPod. / Faye: Why would you need one? / PANEL 2 / Marten: Well, it'd be nice to listen to music on the way to work in the mornings... / PANEL 3 / Pintsize: Why don't you just bring me with you? I have all your mp3s on my hard drive already. / Faye: That WOULD be a lot cheaper than buying an iPod. / Marten: No way. / PANEL 4 / Marten: The one time we tried that, Pintsize just followed me down the street screaming the lyrics to Crazy Train over and over. / Pintsize: Crazy Train is the best song ever.

I remember what happened last time I let you tag along. / PANEL 3 / Faye: What happened last time? / Marten: Pintsize mistook a kid for Apple's version of an AnthroPC, and...well it got ugly. / PANEL 4 / Marten: Lady, I swear to you that he is just a harmless computer, not a "baby-molesting murderbot." / Pintsize: I was only trying to find the power button! / <

Panel 1 / Apple Salesman: Welcome to the Apple Store! Is there anything I can do for you today? / Panel 2 / Marten: Here's what you can do for me: I'm going to purchase a 10 gigabyte iPod, and you're going to help by not trying to sell me any car adapters, extra headphones, docking devices, firewire cables, or anything else unless I specifically ask you about it. / Panel 3 / [[Apple Salesman looks frightened]] / Panel 4 / Faye: He was visibly trembling when you asked what the terms of the extended warranty were! It was so cute! / Marten: The only way to deal with computer salespeople is with an overwhelming preemptive strike.

You know, like something I'd find at the Salvation Army for a nickel? / PANEL 4 / Marten: Okay, you're just being mean now / Faye: Also I am looking for some CDs by really terrible hardcore bands.  Do you have those? / Saleswoman: I am SO putting a curse on you when I get home tonight.

Number 51: There is a spell for thongs
Faye: I don't get the appeal of these Final Fantasy games. Aren't they all the same? / Marten: Maybe so, but they're still a geek's wet dream. I mean, you've got world-changing conflicts, tons of secrets to discover, gorgeous graphics, and even a little romance here and there. They found a formula that works and stuck with it. / Panel 3: no dialogue / Marten: Also there are tits and dragons. / Faye: Apparently it is easier to cast spells in a thong and tube-top.

Fuck rent, I'm buying a guitar. / Faye: That is a highly irresponsible action, but guitars are AWESOME so I cannot be upset.
http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=52
Number Fifty-Three: That Plan Never Works
Panel 1 / Faye: So what kind of guitar are you going to buy? / Marten: I dunno, I was thinking of getting a Telecaster... / Panel 2 / Faye: Maple or rosewood fretboard? / Marten: What difference does it make? / Panel 3 / Faye: Well with a maple board you'll get a bright, twangy tone, whereas rosewood puts out thicker mids and a looser bass response. / Faye: If you're looking for a jangly sound you should go with maple, but if you want fat overdrive like Shiner or Mogwai you might like rosewood better. / Panel 4 / Marten: Wow, how do you know so much about guitars? / Faye: I learned from a guy I dated in high school. When he wasn't trying to get my clothes off he'd blather on endlessly about guitars. / Panel 5 / Marten: Maybe it was just a ploy to bore you into getting naked. / Faye: Fat lot of good it did him. He never saw so much as a nipple.

I had a suitcase full of clothes and not much else. / Panel 2 / Faye: How come you moved here if you had to give up all your stuff? / Marten: Well, it's a long story... / Panel 3 / Marten: Basically I was totally in love with this girl, and... things didn't work out. It was a bad scene. / Marten: After that, I didn't really have anywhere else to go. I didn't want to move back in with my parents, so I stayed here. / Panel 4 / Faye: So you totally left behind your friends and family because you were chasing this girl? / Marten: Pretty much. / Panel 5 / Faye: Well that is very sweet, but completely idiotic. / Marten: Funny, that's what my mom said too.

Number Fifty-Six: Also Songs About Cloning
Panel 1 / Faye: So I totally do not get Deerhoof. What is up with all the songs about pandas and flowers and crap? / Marten: They're post-post-ironic. / Panel 2 / Marten: They've progressed so far into the realm of the absurd that they've come out on the other side, in the land of gleeful sincerity. / Marten: They write songs about pandas and pickup bears and flowers because they really think that those are awesome things to write songs about. / Panel 3 / [[Faye thinks about this]] / Panel 4 / Faye: Pan-da pan-da pan-da pan-da pan-da pan...

Panel 1 / Steve: Why are you so convinced that Faye isn't interested in you? I've seen how she acts around you. / Marten: I don't know what you're talking about. / Panel 2 / Steve: She put her arms around you when she was drunk. She's always flirting with you. I mean for Christ's sake, she's sleeping on your couch! / Steve: How are those NOT signs that she wants to do nasty things to you in a bed? / Panel 3 / Marten: Look. I'm male, therefore I am completely incapable of judging female attraction.   / Marten: It's the Second Law of Sexual Dynamics- if you think a girl is attracted to you, you are wrong.   / Panel 4 / Steve: So what you're saying is there's no way to tell if a girl is interested in you. / Marten: Short of her climbing into my lap and humping vigorously, no.

I feel like a total loser for not having heard of them before, and now I'll never get the chance to see them live or anything. / Panel 3 / Faye: Well, look at it this way: In twenty years, you'll probably be one of the very few people left on the planet who can even REMEMBER that band. That's got to count for something. / Panel 4 / Faye: And hey, at least you're not one of those insufferable dorks who is still devastated that Pavement broke up. / Marten: Oh God, tell me about it.

And why is that? / Marten: When a girl farts it is funny and endearing. When a dude farts, it's just gross. / PANEL 3 / Faye: That is because girls' farts smell like roses and fresh-baked cookies. / Marten: Not judging by how my bathroom smells after you've been in there for fifteen minutes. / PANEL 4 / Faye: Maybe we should not be having this conversation in a crowded diner. / Marten: Quick, placate the other patrons with your rosy cookie gases!

The beard is a way of saying "I am so totally single right now it doesn't even matter that I have this nasty facial hair." / Panel 3 / Marten: Ever notice how girls always say stuff like "oh man that boy would be so much cuter if he didn't have that awful beard"? When the dude eventually DOES shave it off, those girls are all "oh em gee want want want". If he never had the beard, the girls wouldn't have fixated on him in the first place. / Faye: It is a smarmy conspiracy to manipulate indie girls! / Panel 4 / Dora: And you're bucking the trend by remaining clean-shaven? / Marten: Hell no, I would totally get in on the action if I were able to grow more than four hairs on my face. / Faye: I just imagined you with a white-trash 'stache and it made me very very sad.

One minute I'm shutting down for what he says is some "routine maintainance," next thing I know I'm waking up with this awful paint job and an acrylic window displaying my internal organs. / Anthro PC #3: That is really harsh, man. / 3 / Pintsize: I'm really sorry, Ell.  Is there anything I can do to help? / Ellninerr: I don't think so.  I just wish I didn't look like some sort of reject MegaMan villain. / Anthro PC #3: What are you going to do now, Ell? / 4 / Ellninerr: My plan is to wait until my owner falls asleep tonight, then cut a hole in his chest and tape some Saran Wrap over it.  I figure, if it's good enough for me it's good enough for him, right? / Pintsize: An admirable plan, but one that would probably get you thrown in a plastic shredder immediately. / Anthro PC #3: If you put a window in my owner's torso, all you would see is Cheetos and Red Bull.

A girl's head is in the foreground.

I guess theres some truth to it- Christ, there goes ANOTHER girl in one of those skirts!  What the hell? / Faye:  It is like birds' plumage -- whomever best exemplifies the current standard appears to be "fittest" and therefore most desirable. / [[The scene returns to the angle from the second panel.

It is okay if other people do, but I will not abridge or amalgamate my own vocabulary. / Marten: Fine.  I'll just get you drunk tonight.  You're quite liberal with your use of apostrophes after six or seven shots. / Faye: What, you are not going to go the classy route and put roofies in my cocoa?

The whole goth thing was fun in high school, but lately it just seems kind of shallow and pointless to me.  It's like all you do is sit around bragging about how misanthropic you are and how many awful industrial bands you know of.

I will have none of that! You and I are going to have a girls' day out tomorrow. We will get you sorted out! / PANEL 3  / Faye: First we will go to the Salvation Army to get you some less-spooky clothing. Then it is off to the record shop to acquaint you with your new friends Mister Indie Pop and Madam Post-Rock. / Dora: This sounds less like a girls' day out and more like an indoctrination into indie culture. / PANEL 4 / Faye: It is! We are like the Borg from Star Trek, only with better fashion sense! You will be assimilated! / Marten: Wait, better fashion sense? Have you seen Karen O or the guys from Interpol lately? / Pintsize: The Borg were hot.

Dora: So, now that we're out of Marten's presence, admit it - you really were looking at his ass last night. / Faye: Oh fine, if it will get you off my case.  Yes, I did take a quick peek at Marten's bottom.  Happy now? / Dora: Hah!  I knew it!  You are attracted to the boy! / Faye: No no no!  It was just the booze making me a little tingly and setting my eyes a-wander.  That is all there was to it! / Dora: Bull shit, Faye.  You want him.  I bet you think of him when you diddle yourself in the shower. / Faye: I would rather you not speculate on what I may or may not do in the privacy of my daily cleansing ritual. / Dora: Oh, I've done quite a bit of speculating.  You might say it's become part of my daily cleansing ritual. / Faye: Okay, that does it.  We are going to a veterinary clinic to have you spayed.

Highly classified, and highly illegal for a civilian such as yourself to own. / Marten: Dude I bought the chassis at a fuckin' Best Buy.  I didn't steal it out of some bunker in Nevada! / Special Agent Turing: The chassis was "deposited" in a Best Buy truck when our prototype T-32 transport robot attempted to mate with said truck, which we then lost track of in the ensuing chaos.

Yeah mom, I'm sorry too.  Love you, bye bye. / see?  I told you she did not completely disown you, silly Sapphic sister. / Heh.

You ignored her bawlin' when you moved up here in the first place, lil' miss double-standard! / Those were different circumstances and you know it.  I am not meant for the South.  I like snow, and pretty fall foliage, and restaurants that are not Waffle House. / Betcha also like havin' a skinny indie boy to keep you warm at night too. / Would you like to end up in a full-body cast?

Number 178: I am Sorry, Arcade Fire Dude
[[sitting in a booth at a restaurant]] / Marten: So in this band The Arcade Fire, there's this one guy whose only job in a bunch of their sonds is to dance around and beat on this big ol' drum at the appropriate moments. / Faye: And this is all he does? That seems like kind of a silly gimmick. / Marten: Oh no way, it's completely awesome! This guy is a fucking badass -- he doesn't care whether he looks silly or whatever, he just rocks out on that drum as hard as he possibly can. / Marten: You can tell he's just totally caught up in the music, and he really transfers that energy to everyone in the audience. It's actually awe-inspiring to watch. He makes dudes who just stare at their feet while they play look like losers in comparison. / Faye: Hee hee, do you think he is that intense about everything? All "I AM GOING TO BRUSH MY TEETH LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN BRUSHED BEFORE!" in the bathroom every morning? / Marten: Hahaha yeah! "I AM MAKING MYSELF SOME CEREAL AND GODDAMN IF IT ISN'T GOING TO BE THE MOST DELICIOUS CEREAL IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF MANKIND!" / Faye: I am not sure that such intensity would be a good thing when it came to being intimate with a lady. Vigor is always appreciated, but cervical bruising is not. / Marten: Ow. I don't even have a cervix and that thought makes me hurt.

It has been a while since I got my booze on. / Marten: Heh, exchanging waffle-breath for bourbon-breath, are we? / Faye: After a day like today, I think I deserve a good stiff drink. No, make that several good stiff drinks. / Marten: You know, most girls just curl up on the couch with some ice cream and a John Cusack movie after a stressful day. / Faye: Comparing most girls to me is like comparing Sputnik to a space-borne death-laster.

Page thirty-four: "Drusilla gasped as Lord Forwhyllyn loosed his throbbing manhood from the sweaty confines of his breeches and plunged it into her quivering woman-flesh." / Marten: People actually pay you for this? / Faye: Hee hee!

Are you implyin' that I can't hold my liquor? / Marten: No, you seem to be holding your liquor pretty well. The problem is that you're currently holding enough of it to kill and preserve the remains of a rhinocerous. / Faye: His life on the veldt /         cut short by cruel Jim Beam /         Poor Rhinoceros

Y'know, send one more down to see what the other five are doin' down there in my stomach. / Marten: Bad idea. Beeblebrox's Gambit always does more harm than good. That's drunk-logic. / Faye: Drunk logic? / Marten: You know, things that seem like really good ideas when you're drunk, but are actually really dumb. / Faye: Hee hee! Like pickin' a fight with a ninja, or listenin' to Insane Clown Posse! / Faye: Picking a fight with a ninja who listens to ICP would be pretty much the worst thing you could do. / Marten: Nunchaku made from two Faygo bottles, super-baggy ninja pants, katana with "JUGGALO NINJAZ" engraved on the blade.

He did mention that he wanted one a while back, and I could save him some money. / Dora: Mmmm. Pale, skinny indie-boy with short, tousled dark hair. He'd look hot like that. / Faye: Yeah, it'd look nice on him, I think. / Dora: Ah ha! Caught you out at last, and using a contraction no less! Admit it, Faye, you think he's a cutie-pants. / Faye: How is me saying he would look nice with shorter hair a declaration of some hidden attraction for him?! / Dora: I bet this is only the tip of the horny iceberg for you.

{{Number 257: A Brief Chat}} / [[interior Coffee of Doom]] / Faye: How did things go once you were all set up out here? / Marten: Well, things started off good. Gradually, though, she started having less and less time to spend with me. She didn't call anymore. If I wanted to see her I basically had to track her down and triple-check to make sure we had a date set to hang out. / Dora: Man, that's not cool at all. / Marten: Yeah, it really threw me for a lopp, you know? / I tried asking her what was up but she kept shrugging it off. She just had so much work to do, or was too tired, or something. / Marten: I'll never forget the night she finally told me. I had left her like six messages that week, and she eventually  called me back and said "I can't do this anymore. I've moved on, Marten. Please don't call me again." Then she hung up. / Marten: That was the last time I ever spoke to her. / Marten: Uh, Faye? Where are you going? / Faye: [[stalking across room, fist clenched]] Oh, just to have a short chat with your ex-lady-friend over there. / Dora: Remember the rules, Faye. No murdering customers in the store. The back alley exists for a reason.

Panel 1 / Faye: Oh man that felt good. Did you see her run out? Hah! / Dora: Normally that would be grounds for your firing, but in this case I think your actions were justifiable. / Panel 2 / Faye: Oh no, I just realized... Marten, were you planning to confront her? Did I just deny you closure? / Marten: No no, it's fine. I don't really need any closure or whatever. / Panel 3 / Marten: When you get down to it, was it really even that big a deal? A girl I was dating decided she didn't want to see me anymore for some reason. That happens to people all the time, you know? / Marten: The point is, I tried my best. I took a big stupid risk because I was in love with her and it didn't work out, but I'll always be able to look back and say "at least I tried." That's really all the closure I need. / Panel 4 / Marten: And I have to admit, seeing her get hit in the face with a gallon of milk was pretty goddamned gratifying. / Dora: That was a sixty-dollar sweater, too.  Good going, Faye. / Faye: I am a milk ninja!

Morbid, yet entertaining. / [[Faye hands Marten coffee]] / Marten: Hmm. I could see Wilco breaking up sometime soon... / Faye: No no, they won't break up. Jeff Tweedy will just pass out in a gutter somewhere and it'll take them a couple months to find him. / Marten: [[sipping coffee]] Actually, I bet it'll be the Arcade Fire. They seem so intense about their music that they might just collapse under the pressure of all their success. / Faye: [[making hand gestures]] Win Butler's head explodes during a performance of "Wake Up", forcing them to replace him with a Homestar Runner puppet. / Faye: I hope Iron & Wine doesn't break up. / Marten: Isn't that basically just one guy?

When we turn him back on, he might not remember me, or you, or anything htat's happened to him since I first botted him up. / Marten: It's like being told your best friend is in a coma and they don't know if he has any brain damage.

If I had lost all my memory, would I still be the same Pintsize, or would I be a different person? / Marten: Well, that's a pretty classic question. Are we defined by our experiences, or by our moment-to-moment existence? / PANEL 3 / Faye: We're defined by our past. That's what we use to filter and interpret our current existence. / Marten: But it's a two way street. We constantly re-evaluate our view of the past based on our current experiences as well. I think you'd still be Pintsize, you'd just be experiencing your past second-hand since you couldn't remember it yourself anymore. / PANEL 4 / Faye: Excuse me, boys. This metaphysical talk is fun and all, but I need to go re-evaluate my view of the bathroom based on my current experience of this cup of coffee. / Marten: Centuries of philosophical debate reduced to a toilet joke. Nice. / Pintsize: When talking about the human experience, it all comes back to poopin' eventually.

Are you implying that there's something wrong with my current look? / Marten: What? No, I- / Panel 4 / Faye: Silly Marten, I'm only joking around.

Why not just let them be? / Faye: It's not being mean, it's just deriving amusement from the poor self-image decisions of others. They're perfectly entitled to dress like Emo Hobos if they want, just as I'm entitled to smirk at them behind their backs. / PANEL 3 / Marten: "Emo Hobos?" / Faye: I predict it will be the next big emo fashion trend. I mean, nobody is more miserable than a homeless person, right? That's like the Holy Grail of feeling sorry for yourself! / PANEL 4 / Faye: Imagine it: packs of disaffected youth with elaborate haircuts huddling around burning oil drums, swapping stories of sharing rail-cars with Sunny Day Real Estate and passing around a bottle of moonshine cut with their own tears. / Marten: Some dude with scabies singing about how his girlfriend was swept away when the underpass flooded...his band is a guy playing a broken ukelele and a dog beating its tail against a garbage can...they're all "we're not emo hobos, we're emotional hobocore!"

What did you major in? / Faye: You have to guess. Nobody ever figures it out on their own. / Marten: English major? Nah, too obvious... / PANEL 4 / Marten: Ooh, did you major in something sexy? Gender and Sexuality or something? That's unlike you enough that no one would guess it. / Faye: Hmm. Do I punch you for making such a tasteless and typically male remark, or for implying that no one would think of me as a sensual person? / Marten: See, now that sounds like something a Women's Studies major would say.

I guess I don't look artisitc enough or something. / Pintsize: I think you look very artistic, like one of the ladies in a Reubens painting, or- / PANEL 4 / Faye: Did I mention that my preferred media were melted plastic and dismantled electronics?

PANEL 1 / Faye: Ooh, this looks like it could be interesting. / Marten: Hmm? / PANEL 2 / Faye: Two bedroom apartment, close to downtown, and newly renovated.  144 Dwight Street. / Marten: Hmm, rent looks reasonable too.   That's not much more than we pay for this place. / Steve: 144 Dwight street?  I think that's the same building ellen and her roomate live in! / PANEL 3 / Faye: Well fancy that.  Looks like we could end up neighbors with your little redhead lady-friend! / Marten: That's almost disturbingly Friends-esque, when you think about it. / Steve: Haha, would that make you two Ross and Rachel or Chandler and Monica? / PANEL 4 / Steve: I...I probably shouldn't have said that out loud, should I. / Faye: Look at the bright side. When I'm done beating you senseless, the concussion will make friends seem a whole lot funnier than it actually is. / Marten: Actually, i think it takes a lot more than a concussion to make network TV funny.  Maybe massive brain damage.

[[Faye and Marten in their apartment with Steve]] / Faye: Okay, we are scheduled to go see the apartment tomorrow. / Marten: Awesome, thanks Faye. / Steve: That reminds me, I'm due to meet Ellen for some food.  I'll let her know you two will be in the area tomorrow. / Faye: Oh, so we'll see you there tomorrow morning then.  All disheveled, pink lipstick on your shirt, fly unzipped, pompadour askew... / Steve: I told you, we're not gettin' it on yet. / Faye: Pff, not for long.  When it comes to the sideways samba, boys have the willpower of a package of Jello if they find a willing lady. / Marten: I have a hard enough time even finding one of those. / Steve: That's your own fault, dude.  It's like someone told you to go climb a hill and you're scaling Mount Everest naked. / Faye: What is he referring to?  Why are you climing mountains naked? / Marten: Sometimes I wonder that myself.

Number 284: Initiation Ceremony
[[Dora and Raven in Coffe of Doom]] / Dora: So what brings you here anyway, Raven?  Surely you're not just looking for someone to horrify with your trend-hopping. / Raven: Actually, I was wondering if you were hiring. / Dora: Raven, honey, you're a nice kid but there's no way I can hire you.  I know you've never worked in a coffee shop before, and I need people who have at least some experience. / Raven: Pleeease?  I'll do anything you want me to do!  I can wash dishes in the back or mop the floors or whatever! / Faye: Hi Dora, sorry I'm late.  Who's little miss vintage? / Dora: Faye, this is Raven.  She's trying to convince me to hire her. / Faye: It looks like a Jimmy Eat World video threw up on her.  Shall I fetch a mop and bucket? / Dora: Heh.  Okay, here's the deal.  If you can survive a shift with insultosaurus here, you're hired.  Clean-up detail and register only until you learn the ropes, then we'll see if you're bright enough to make a decent cup of coffee. / Faye: So either I get to break you psychologically, or you get to clean the customer bathroom instead of me?  Awesome, I win either way! / Raven: Um...yay for me?

Dude with the big dorky glasses!  Come and get your mocha! / Raven: Have you guys ever tried bringing your customers their drinks instead of making them get it? / Faye: No, why would we do that? / Raven: I dunno, to be nice? / Customer: Thank you. / Dora: Thank you WHAT? / Customer: Th-thank you ma'am! / Faye: Listen kiddo, we're barristas, not Hooters girls.  We are expected to be aloof and icy.  When you buy a cup of coffee, you want it served to you by an untouchable Coffee Goddess, not some giggling trollop. / Raven: But wouldn't you get more business if you were nice to your customers? / Faye: You try your little "being nice to the customers" thing and see how cheery you feel after the fifteenth guy stammers out his order while staring at your chest. / Dora: [[looking down her top]] Faye gets that a lot more than I do. / Raven: Since when is guys staring at my chest a bad thing?

Just because other people who look like me are sad all the time doesn't mean I have to be. / Dora: What an... oddly enlightened response.  Is she too shallow to be concerned with identity issues, or am I too shallow not to be? / Faye: Hee!

Have a nice day! / Marten: Hello ladies.  Who's the chick in the red shirt? / Faye: Oh, that's Raven.  You didn't touch her, did you?  We'll have to wash the emo off with a hose. / Dora: She's an old acquaintance of mine who we might be hiring to help out around here. / Faye: Hmph.  Look at her, gabbing gaily away with the customers.  I'd gag if she weren't raking in the tips. / Dora: Yeah, she does seem to have a way with people.  I don't get it. / Marten: I dunno, it makes sense to me.  She's kinda cute. / Marten: I mean, not that you two aren't, uh, I mean she seems friendlier... uh, not friendlier than YOU per se, but it's just uh ah I uh... / Dora: It's okay Marten, you're allowed to think- / Faye: No, no, let him keep digging himself this hole.

Number 288: Safety Lease
Dora: You're moving? / Marten: Yeah, we're looking at a place tomorrow.  Apparently it's in the same building as Steve's new lady-friend. / Faye: I hope either the walls are plenty thick or we're a few floors away from them.  I do not want to hear their gettings-on. / Dora: Didn't want to give Marten up as a roommate, eh Faye? / Faye: Well he is fairly clean for a boy, and I'm almost certain he won't try to fondle me in my sleep.  It's a convenient arrangement. / Dora: I like how the only positive things you have to say about him are "well he's not TOO messy" and "he probably won't try to rape me" when he's been letting you stay at his place for months now. / Faye: Well I mean it's obvious he's a nice boy, that goes without saying.  What I am making a point of is that he is also clean and unlikely to inflict harm upon me. / Marten: Wouldn't me sexually assaulting someone sort of negate my "nice boy" status anway? / Dora: Hah, imagine if it didn't! "Oh yeah, Bob's a great guy. I mean he raped a bunch of sorority girls, but whatever. He helped me fix my lawnmower!" / Marten: You know, I should put that on the rental application for the new place.  "Steady job, good references, unlikely to molest other tenants." / Faye: I would imagine that having a building free of sexual predators IS an attractive notion to most landlords, yes.  Smart ass.

They're such a rare breed of girl these days. / Faye: Pff, you'd never find one equal to me. I am the Hope diamond of hipster girls. / Marten: You mean you're cursed? / Faye: I'd punch you for that, but I should have seen it coming. / Dora: Sass notwithstanding, you kids are my friends. I'd be lonely without you around. / Marten: Aw well you're our friend too Dora. We're not going anywhere. / Faye: Sheesh, get a room you two. / Dora: You're just jealous because I don't need to be blitzed to show affection. / Faye: That's...that's not true! / Dora: Oh yeah?

Now it is YOUR responsibility to clean the bathrooms every morning when you come in. / Raven: N-no!

I know, I get them myself sometimes.  Come hang out with us tonight. / Dora: O -- okay, I guess I can. See you guys later tonight then. / [[Faye and Marten on the street]] / Faye: That was astoundingly assertive of you.  Does someone have a wee crush on le Dora after all? / Marten: No, I just recognized that expression, and when I'm feeling that way I always end up havin' a crappy night if I don't force myself to go out and do something. / [[Back at the cafe]] / Raven: Dora? Are you okay? / Dora: No. Here I was planning a whole night of feeling sorry for myself and stupid Marten with his puppy-dog eyes has to go and ruin it for me. / Raven: So you're sad about not being able to mope all night becuase a cute boy asked you over to his place? Are you SURE you're not goth anymore?

[[Marten and Faye enter their apartment carrying booze]] / Marten: I can't believe you can actually drink that stuff. / Faye: Hey now, don't talk shit about the Midnight Hobo.  It may be distilled in empty oil drums out by the train tracks, but it's wonderfully efficient booze. / Marten: Uh, Pintsize? What's with the necktie? / Pintsize: I will be unable to join in your reindeer games tonight. I have a date. A SEXY date! / Faye: A date? Like, with another AntroPC? / Pintsize: Yep, we have a private IRC chatroom all set up and everything. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm due to sign on.  If the router starts a-rockin' don't come a-knockin'! / [[Marten grabs the rotgut]] / Faye: Hey, I thought you didn't like that stuff. / Marten: I don't, but this will be the most efficient way of blotting out the realization that my computer has a more active love life than me. / Pintsize: Actually, if the router really does start a-rockin' do you think you could weigh it down with something heavy? I don't want a cable to come loose and disconnect me.

She has to go hang out with some friends of hers tonight. / Kitty: Mew? / Dora: Nervous? No, why would I be nervous? / Dora: A long history of social anxiety that I usually try to hide by being aloof and smartypants? Uncertainty about my motives towards Marten and his issues with Faye? The possibility of getting drunk and doing somthing I might later regret? The pimple on my butt that just won't go away? / Kitty: Mew mew meow mew. / Dora: Yes, I realize that projecting my internal dialogue onto my cat is perhaps not the healthiest way of dealing with stressful situations. / Kitty: Meow. / Dora: No, murder is not the answer.

Come on in. / Marten:  Can I get you something to drink?  We've got beer and hard cider in the fridge. / Dora:  Hard cider, please.  I have the tolerance of a mole rat. / Faye:  There you are!  And here I figured you had resigned yourself to another night of mopery and sighing. / Dora:  What, and miss watching you slowly dissolve into a pool of pure ethanol? / Faye:  After I am dead, my remains will make an excellent disinfectant and household cleaner. / Dora:  Or jet fuel, judging by the smell of whatever it is you're drinking. / Marten:  Actually, are you sure you're not drinking jet fuel already?

Number 295: Uno
[[Dora, Marten, and Faye playing Uno at the apartment]] / Dora:  What the heck are we listening to anyway?  It sounds like the Who writing music for ADD kids. / Faye:  It's a band called the Fiery Furnaces.  This is their magnum opus, Blueberry Boat. / Dora:  Oh, ok.  I think I heard a couple hipsters arguing about these guys in the coffee shop the other day. / Marten:  Yeah, it's a pretty polarized record -- either you love it or you can't stand it. / Faye:  Or it liquifies your brain! / Dora:  I kind of like it, I just wish it'd calm down a little bit.  It's like they tried to cram every idea they ever had into each song. / Marten:  They just put out an EP of their singles and b-sides and it's actually a lot more accessible than this record. / Faye:  Hordes of mindless zombie, moaning about sailing ships and blueberry pirates... / Dora:  I love how you indie kids can listen to this stuff with a straight face and then decry Type O Negative as melodramatic and silly. / Marten:  Well, the Fiery Furnaces are basically the indie rock Meatloaf, only with more keyboards and less body odor. / Faye:  ...Actually I think I just described the average Decemberists concert audience.

The best kind of busy! / Faye:  If they're goin' at it, he just won't answer his cell phone. / Marten:  True... / Dora:  You realize that according to Murphy's law they will indeed be getting it on when Faye calls. / Faye:  Hey pompadourasaurus, you busy?  No? Well get you and your bonita Lolita over here.  Fun times are afoot! / Marten:  Well I'll be damned, I guess Murphy took the night off. / Dora:  He's busy boning Lady Luck! / [[Ellen, naked in Steve's bed]] / Steve:  Come on sweetie, we're heading over to Marten's to hang out. / Ellen:  Aww, are you sure you don't want to do it again? / Steve:  Baby, you're wonderful but if we keep this up one of us is gonna end up with a broken pelvis.

I am so sorry, we'll be more quiet next time I promise! / Natasha:  Nah, don't worry about it.  Next time I'll just put on my headphones. / [[Steve walks in]] / Steve:  Which raises the question of why you didn't just put them on this time. / Natasha:  Ellen's like my little sister, dude.  I had to make sure you weren't inflicting any harm upon her. / Ellen:  Hardly. / Steve:  Hey I don't know what she's been telling you but I'm not into the whole S&M; deal.

I'm an efficient drunk, when I want to be. / Faye: Oh, is that your goal?  Tryin' to loosen yourself up a bit tonight?  Maybe make a move on our currently-urinating host? / Dora: No, just tryin' to overcome a depressive episode the old fashioned way -- by drowning it in alcohol. / Faye: That was... unexpectedly candid. Are you okay, hun? / Dora: I have a feeling I will be after another cider. / Faye: Dora, alcohol is not a good means of self-medication!  Ignore the fact that I am a pot calling your kettle-butt black. I'm drunk and allowed to be a bit hypocritical. / Dora: Heh. If my butt's a kettle, yours is a cauldron.

It's nothing a little booze and a lot of Uno won't fix. / Martin: You sure? I mean, if you need to talk about anything, I can... / Dora: Please, Marten.  I'm not going to force you to piece out my every little personality quirk like sort of emo jigsaw puzzle.  You get that enough as it is. / Martin: Haha, I do? / Faye: He does? / Martin: [[pointing to Faye]] Ohh, you mean... Uh, nevermind. I have no idea what you are talking about or to whom you are referring. / Faye: I wasn't aware this was "get drunk and poke fun at Faye's personality" night.  Had I known I would have worn a silly hat to make my dysfunction all the more noticeable. / Dora: Ooh, a Ridicule Hat! What a good idea! We should get one for the coffee shop.

Thank you Marten! / Ellen: It's so nice to be treated as an adult instead of some stupid teenager. / Faye: You _are_ a teenager. / Ellen: Yeah, but not a stupid one. / Faye: That's debatable.

I'm pretty drunk though, so I apologize in advance if I make an ass of myself at some point tonight. / Marten:  Heheh.  How do you know you haven't already? / Dora:  Because I still have all my clothes on, the police aren't kicking down the door, and Faye isn't trying to blackmail me with a videotape of my actions. / Marten:  I don't think Faye is sober enough to operate a video camera right now, but you might want to lay off the alcohol for a little while anyway.

They make fun of you if you try to get any actual work done on them.

Number 304:  I Am Bad At Connect Four
[[On the couch in Marten's apartment]] / Ellen:  ...They always stick their arms through the holes and try to climb out of the tank.  My professor thinks that the octopuses just don't know how to play Connect Four, but my theory is that they're actually playing a game of their own, and we researchers are their pawns. / Faye:  I'm just drunk enough to completely believe that. / [[Aside to Marten]] / Dora: Oh-say, Arten-may, ow-hay are ings-thay owing-gay ith-way Aye-fay? / Marten:  Huh?  Oh, I get it.  They're pretty much the same as ever. / [[Note stuck to the fridge reads, "DO NOT EAT THE HAM"]] / Marten:  She sort of has an un-pig-latin-able first name, doesn't she.  Well anyway, my plan is still to just take it easy and see how things go. / Dora:  I think that's the best you can do.  Besides, you're fun to conspire with.  We can be hella sneaky together! / Faye:  What're you two talkin' about?  Was Dora speakin' in tongues a minute ago? / Dora:  [[looking Heavenwards]] Yes, I found Jesus just now. / Marten:  Turns out he was in the kitchen this whole time.

[[In Marten's apartment]] / Steve: Well guys, it's been fun, but we should probably get going. / Ellen: Thank you for inviting me! / Faye: No problem kiddo. See you around. / [[They leave]] / Marten: Aww yeah, alone with two fine-ass ladies at last. Time for some hot threesome action. / Faye: Okay that was so brazenly over the top that I just can't punch you for it. / Dora: Aww, you were joking? / Marten: Thass right baby, don't punch. Give in to the LOVE. Get on the Marten train to Dora town, baby. / Faye: Gah! / Dora: Dora town is a sexy place! Rawr! / Marten: Ow ow ow! No more hitting! I was just jokin' around! / Faye: I am teaching you the concept of "taking a joke too far." Now hold still so I can strike you some more. / Dora: Aww, you were joking again?

Number 306:  EyeHateSkynyrd
[[In Marten's apartment]] / Faye:  Ahh, much better.  I had to race like a piss-horse. / Dora:  Piss-horse would make an awesome name for a souther doom-metal band. / Marten:  Heh, they'd play Lynyrd Skynyrd songs tuned down to drop-G and at a fourth their original speed.  Their version of "Freebird" would be like forty-seven minutes long! / Faye:  You seem to be cheering right up, Dora.  I can practically see the angsty-toxins seeping from your pores! / Dora:  It's like I told you.  Sometimes all a girl needs is some alcohol and social interaction to brighten her mood. / Dora:  Plus I got some eye-candy earlier when Marten was flexing for you.  Rawr!  [[she pokes him]] / Faye:  Eye-candy?  Where?  The boy is skinnier than a slide-rule with an eating disorder. / Marten:  I appreciate the implication that while I may be freakishly emaciated, I am at least highly scientific. / Dora:  Oh don't play dumb, Faye.  We all know you like ze skinny boys. / Faye:  I like to punch them.  They fly farther. / Marten:  At sufficiently high velocity, the skinny indie rock dude forms what people in the aerospace industry call a "lifting body."  NASA's next generation orbital vehicle will be powered entirely by Guided By Voices fans being kicked repeatedly by a drunken Bob Pollard.

Number 307: Crash Test Dummy
[[In Marten's apartment.  Faye pulls down one strap of her top to scratch.]] / Faye:  Gah, itchy boob! / Dora:  Woah, that's a hell of a scar you've got there, Faye.  How did that happen? / Marten:  I've asked her but she won't tell me. / [[Faye reveals the scar more]] / Faye:  I was in a pretty bad car accident a few years ago.  I wrapped my car around a tree and was in the hospital for a couple days afterward.  The doctors weren't really sure what caused the cut, but it was pretty deep -- apparently there's a little notch in a couple of the ribs beneath the scar now.  It still itches sometimes. / Marten:  Well, I'm glad you came out of it okay in the end. / Faye:  Yeah... / Dora:  I have a couple little pockmarks on my right butt-cheek from where a dog bit me when I was eleven. / Marten:  A dog bit you on the ass?  How did that happen? / Dora:  I was kind of mooning it at the time.  My big brother dared me to do it. / Faye:  I'd ask to see proof of this canine bottom-bite, but I'm afraid the glare from your ivory booty-flesh would blind us all.

Thanks for convincing me to come hang out tonight.  It turned out to be a lot more fun than moping around my apartment and being ignored by my cat. / [[Back in the livingroom]] / Marten:  Man, this has been a fun evening.  It's nice to get everyone together and just hang out for a while, you know? / Faye:  Indeed.  I must say, you and Dora were thick as thieves tonight.  Is there something going on there that I'm not aware of? / Marten:  Yes.  I am suave and cunning enough to hook up with Dora but keep you entirely unaware of it until just now.  We were totally banging in the kitchen earlier. / Faye:  Holy crap, I can't believe you managed to say that with a straight face.  I think this is the first time you've ever out-sarcasmed me!

Number 309:  Language Barrier
[[In Marten's apartment, cleaning up after the party]] / Faye:  Marten, will you promise me something? / Marten:  Hmm? / Faye:  If some other girl eventually gets together with you, promise me you won't let her steal you away completely. / Faye:  I value my friendship with you, and I'd be really sad if you stopped talkin' to me or hanging out with me because you were seein' some other lady.  I mean, I'm not sayin' you can't date other girls!  Just... if you do, please don't leave me in the dust, y'know? / Marten:  I...I think I understand what you're saying.  I mean if I did hypothetically start dating another girl I would still want you to be my friend.  I can promise that that won't change. / Faye:  Thank you, Marten.  I mean, I'm still plannin' to keep you entirely to myself, but it's good to know anyway. / Marten:  Okay now was that you being playfully possessive or were you actually being serious? / Faye:  Well I'm drunk an' not entirely in control of what my mouth is sayin' right now, so you be the judge. / Marten:  No, see, that doesn't help.  It's like you were speaking perfect English and then lapsed into some obscure dialect of Girlese or something.

We have an apartment to look at in half an hour sharp. / Marten:  Muh.  Are those different glasses? / [[interior Marten's blue living room]] / Faye:  Yep! I picked them up this morning while you were sleeping it off.  Do you like them? / Marten:  They look nice. / Pintsize:  I want to come look at the apartment too! / Faye:  No.  We want to at least have a chance of getting it if it's nice. / Marten:  Sorry buddy, but she's got a point. / Pintsize:  Well all right then.  I guess I'll just stay here alone... all by myself with Faye's underwear and your guitar... who knows what might happen to them... / [[Faye duct tapes Pintsize to the wall]] / Faye:  Consider your bluff called. / Pintsize:  Curses!

[[on the street]] / Marten:  Gah! Dammit! / Faye:  What's the matter? / Marten:  [[adjusting himself]] These stupid boxer shorts don't have a button on the front and my junk keeps sneaking out. / Faye:  Thank you for the unnecessary briefing on the status of your boy-parts.  Would you like your beating now, or when we get home later? / Marten:  This is from the girl who routinely grosses me out with the details about her period. / Faye:  The menstrual cycle is a perfectly natural part of the female reproductive system. / Marten:  I didn't say it wasn't natural.  I said talking about it is gross. / Faye:  When you became my friend you were automatically enrolled in the Menstrual Discussion Plan.

[[in the new apartment]] / Faye:  Hey, this is pretty nice! / Lorena:  Kitchen's off to the left, bedrooms and bath are on the right.  It's a corner apartment so you get a lot of light during the day. / Faye:  Ooh, the kitchen has a dishwasher! / Lorena:  Everything is newly renovated and a lot of people in the building are around your age.  It's pretty quiet, although the lady who lives in 226 vacuums at odd hours sometimes. / Marten:  Right on, I think we can handle muffled vacuum noises. / Faye:  Marten, I really like this place.  What do you think? / Marten:  It looks pretty good to me. / Lorena: They really did a great job of fixing it up.  You'd never know there was a murder-suicide in here six months ago. / [[Marten looks shocked]] / Faye: ...Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that.  It was in the fine print in the classified ad. / Lorena:  Okay, I'm impressed that you saw through my little joke, but playing along?  That's just cold.

I'm so excited for this!  I want to thank you again, Marten! / Marten:  Thank me? For what? / Faye:  You take me in when I need a place to stay, then you agree to move to a bigger one so I can have a little more room.  You've been nothing but generous and kind to me. / Faye:  I know I'm not the easiest person in the world to get along with, but you try anyway.  That means a lot to me.  I don't know how to thank you enough. / Marten:  I have a list.  Every time I do something nice for you, it goes on that list.  Eventually I'll have done so many nice things for you that the only way you'll be able to repay me is with insane amounts of lovin'. / Faye:  Right, because nothing puts a lady in the mood for sexin' like false altruism. / Marten:  It's cheaper than diamonds and twice as socially conscious!

We were up late last night. / Faye: We can just infer my obligatory joke about the two of you goin' at it like frenzied weasels and move on from there. / Marten:  So does that make this a meta-Fayesical conversation? / [[Ellen and Faye stare at Marten]] / Marten:  See, the joke is that I know puns aren't funny!  It's meta-humor! / Ellen:  You know, I was wondering why he was still single, but now I think I understand. / Faye:  He's like an incontinent kitten.

I even took a shower! / Steve:  And she made me smell her armpits to prove it. / Steve:  But yeah, I think we're past that whole awkward "hanging out with your girlfriend's roommate who you don't really know" stage. / Natasha:  You handled it well.  Ellen actually hid from the last boy I brought home. / Ellen:  He had a purple mohawk and like thirty-twelve facial piercings!  I thought he was gonna carve me up and use my femur as a decoration for his septum! / Natasha:  Yeah, he was hot.  Too bad his intelligence turned out to be inversely proportional to the amount of metal in his face. / Steve:  By that reckoning, I'm the next Socrates! / Ellen:  You know, employing the Socratic Method in the bedroom could be pretty interesting.

He's skinny and has dark hair and listens to weird indie music.  You'd probably like him. / Natasha:  Oh really? / Panel 3 / Steve:  Don't go getting your hopes up.  He's totally fixated on Faye. / Ellen:  I dunno, he and Dora seemed pretty friendly with each other last night. / Natasha:  Oh, a love triangle! / Panel 4 / Ellen:  More like a confusion, lust, and uncertainty triangle. / Steve:  I think Marten's problem is that he's afraid of the rhombus of rejection. / Natasha:  My love life is non-Euclidean geometry by comparison.

Let me get my aloof sneer warmed up and we'll be on our way. / Marten:  Your what? / Faye:  My aloof sneer.  It's how indie chicks establish a pecking order.  The girl who looks the most bored and condescending in a given social situation is the Alpha Female. / Marten: And what, pray tell, is the point of being the Alpha Female? / Faye:  She gets her pick of the males, who have their own hierarchy based on a combination of slouching, emaciation, and scruffiness. / Marten:  So basically indie culture is like a pack of wolves but with unfortunate haircuts. / Faye:  Exactly!  Instead of having puppies, the alpha couple wear each other's pants and make out sloppily in the front row at shows. / Marten:  You could probably replace the singer of The Walkmen with a howling wolf and nobody would notice.

I seem to recall Tiny Mix Tapes giving it a good review. / Marten:  Do you ever wonder how much of this stuff people actually enjoy, and how much they just think they like because Pitchfork or whoever says it was good? / Faye:  What's the difference between thinking you like something and actually enjoying it?  There's no empirical standard for appreciation- either you like it, or you don't. / Marten: I know, I'm just suspicious of whether music reviews color my opinion of bands that I might otherwise feel differently about. / Faye:  That's a common misconception about criticism.  A good review doesn't tell you whether you should like or dislike something, it discusses strengths and weaknesses and invites you to make up your own mind based on the information and perspective offered you. / Marten:  I think my big worry is that what if, deep down in my subconsciousness, there's a Good Charlotte fan begging to be let out? / Faye:  Don't go down that road, Marten.  There are some parts of ourselves we were not meant to see!

Besides, have you seen Lou Reed lately?  He looks like a corpse animated by dark magics.

Things never turn out the way you expect. / Marten: How so? / Faye: when I was younger, I'd see these twenty-something hipster girls sitting at outdoor cafes chatting with their friends, and I'd think, "Man, those girls have basically perfect lives."  Perfect hair, trendy clothing, so sure of themselves.  / Faye: Now I *am* one of those girls, and my live *isn't* perfect, and I *do* have things to worry about and problems to deal with.  It makes me sad because as niave as I was back then, I still wish I had been right. / Faye: It's depressing to realize that life basically just gets harder and more complicated the older you get. / Marten: I dunno about that.  Life may get trickier, but you also get a lot of good stuff you didn't have when you were younger. / Faye: I await your stereortypical male use of sex as a prime example.  Go on, get it over with. / Marten: I don't think I'm allowed to use that as an example if it's been so long since I got laid that I barely remember what it was *like*. / Marten: On the plus side, my brain is so preoccupied with the fear of not getting any booty ever again that I don't have any room left for existential crises.

Number 327: Unflattering Hats
[[Faye is trying on hats]] / Marten:  You were unusually morose back there at the cafe.  Is something wrong? / Faye:  A mometary lapse in my equipoise, nothing more. / [[Faye is in a cowboy hat]] / Marten:  Equipoise? / Faye:  The sublime balance of emotion.  It's a Southern thing --  Robert E. Lee was like the Buddha of equipoise. / [[Faye is in a Confederate Army hat]] / Marten:  The Civil War general?  The one who looks kinda like Colonel Sanders? / Faye:  You're lucky we're up North -- comparing Lee to the KFC guy would get you shot in Savannah, honey. / Marten:  But it'd be in a really mellow manner, right?  "Oh deah, that Yankee has besmirched the good General Lee's name.  Mamie, fetch the squirrel rifle if it wouldn't be too much trouble, and we'll have mint juleps on the veranda after the execution." / Faye:  That's right, keep mocking my heritage.  See how far you can go before I club you with a musket. / Marten:  NASCAR is a Yankee conspiracy to keep you all placated so the South won't rise again.

Number 328: He's Quite Tall
[[In the Coffee of Doom]] / Raven: Can I help you? / Sven: Yeah, is Dora here? / Dora: Well well, if it isn't my dear older brother. You know, I was just telling some friends last night about the time you dared me to moon Mrs. Goldstein's chihuahua. / Sven: I never expected him to actually bite you, much less hang on the way he did. Tenacious little bastard. / Dora: So what brings you to my little shop? You hate coffee, I know that's not your motive. / Sven: I dunno, just though I'd drop by and say hello. I haven't talked to you in a while. So how have you been, sis? / Dora: My life is a maelstrom of conflict, drama, and confusion. / Sven: So same old, same old. Gotcha. / Raven: [[aside to Dora]] Omigod your brother is totally hot! Can you set me up with him? / Dora: Sure, and while I'm at it I'll break his kneecaps and give him a case of the avian flu. It'll be a hat-trick of sibling cruelty. / Sven: What's this about hat tricks and cruelty? Are you finally starting that sado-masochistic hockey league you've always wanted?

What do you have for Thanksgiving dinner, two peas and a slice of turkey breast? / Dora: Yeah right. He ate half the damn turkey before I could even finish my salad last year. / Sven: It's been suggested that I'm powered by a small black hole. / Marten: Hey, at least you could use that to pick up hot lady physicists. / Sven: Do those exist?

I'm not proud of that one, but it pays the bills.  You'd be amazed at some of the crap people will buy in Nashville. / Dora:  Poor little tormented artiste. / Marten:  How do you write cheesy country songs if you don't like them in the first place? / Sven:  I usually just come up with a goofy title and then build from there.  "Me an' You an' a Gun-Rack for Two", "Red Neck, White Truck, Blue Jeans", that sort of thing. / Marten:  Crazy.  I wonder if that would work in other genres. / Sven:  I tried and tried to find a buyer for "Drinkin' to Forget (During Built to Spill's Set)" but nobody was interested. / Dora:  Aww, and I liked the lyrics to that one so much, too.  "You wore Converse / I wore Vans / Then I saw you at the Decemberists show / With another man..."

It's always cool to see bands before they get really well known.  I caught the Arcade Fire back when they were on tour with the Unicorns a while ago. / Sven: Mmm, not bad.

But when I come back she better still be in one piece.  No murdering her. / Faye:  Am I still allowed to murder customers?

[[Outside the Coffe of Doom]] / Marten:  You done laughing yet?  Can we go back inside? / Faye:  Hee hee hee, okay.  Man, I was afraid I'd poop myself if that kept up. / [[walking inside]] / Marten:  Any sign of Raven? / Faye:  She's probably cowering in the broom closet or something.  Covered in blood of undetermined origin, clutching a bag of ground decaf to use as a bludgeon in case of attack. / [[coming out of the Employees Only door]] / Raven:  Faye? You're back? / Faye:  Yeah, I realized I couldn't just ditch you like that.  It'd be like leaving a puppy out in a snowstorm. / Marten:  Oh, is that why the ASPCA keeps calling and asking for you? / Faye:  Yeah, probably.  You can ignore the phone calls from PETA though, there's no proof that the kitten was still alive when I bit its head off. / Raven:  Is there, like, a manual that explains how to tell when you're being serious and when you're joking?  Or a FAQ or something?

Oh good, Raven is still in one piece. / Raven:  I learned how to make coffee! / Faye:  Our team of researchers was stunned to discover that Ravens can be taught how to safely operate a bean grinder. / Dora:  Woah, you played nice?  What brought on this change of heart? / Faye:  It's not a change of heart so much as the challenge of forging her into something a little more useful than a cute smile and an empty head. / Dora:  I dunno, she's a nice counterpart to your sardonic grin and brainful o' issues. / Faye:  "Brainful O' Issues"?  What's that, some sort of Freudian breakfast cereal?  "Now with Oedipal marshmallow bits!" / Marten:  I'm somewhat uncomfortable with the concept of an Oedipal marshmallow cereal. / Dora:  I'm more uncomfortable with the idea of a mother buying that for her son.  "Here honey, eat this, go kill Dad, and then we'll bone." / Faye: Each box has a hidden prize: A cigar that really is just a cigar... OR IS IT? / Marten:  I hope it's tastier than Nietzsche-Os.  Eat a bowl of those and you really will believe that God is dead.

Even setting aside the fact that your gender is a software construct and not some physical difference, who cares whether you like getting it on with boy-robots or girl-robots or whatever? / Pintsize:  It's not the fact that we're both set to "male" that bothers me.  I thought he was a lady, and he thought I knew he was not a lady. Neither of us reacted well. / Faye:  But you still had fun, right?  And you still like this other AnthroPC, right? / Pintsize:  Well, yeah. / Marten:  Then go with it, dude.  If it makes you happy, it makes you happy.  I'm sure you can work things out from there. / [[Printed on Marten's coffee cup, :P]] / Pintsize:  I must say, I'm glad you're both being so understanding about this.  A lot of AnthroPC owners get pretty freaked out by the whole "semi-asexual" thing. / Marten:  Whatever, man.  If *somebody* in this apartment doesn't start getting some booty, the combined frustration will kill us all. / Faye:  Hey, I am not frustrated.  My lady-parts are simply on a coitus hiatus.

The singing is off-ket because of all the injustice in the world today! / Faye: Wait, no, nevermind. I just saw him take a big pull from a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 and now he's yelling about "the gummit". Your crazy drunken bum hypothesis has been confirmed. / Martin: The guitar is out of tune because of alcohol!

I feel a lot safer at indie rock shows where everyone just stands there with their arms folded. / Natasha:  That is so lame.  At a hardcore show you can break a dude's nose and he'll high-five you, but if you accidentally make eye contact with someone at an indie show it's the biggest social faux pas ever. / Steve:  Indie kids are like gorillas -- peaceful by nature, but if you make eye contact they see it as a challenge. / Natasha:  A challenge to what, see who has the biggest boner for Stephen Malkmus? / Ellen:  Natasha! / Steve:  Actually it's usually the chick from Cat Power.

But Marten says I should spend the money on something I actually need.

I was feeling a bit exploratory and decided to see what good a dose of jolly olde England might do me, and I daresay it is a marked improvement! / Marten: Well suit yourself, but there better not be any of this "colonizing India" or "starting wars with Spain" business, understood? / Pintsize: Righto!

If you ever do feel like talking about it, I'd be happy to hear the story. / Faye: Thank you, Marten.  I'm sure someday I will, but I'm not in the right headspace yet.  I really appreciate how patient you are with me. / Marten: At this point it's either continue to be patient or kill you and dump your body in a ditch, and I wouldn't last five minutes in prison. / Faye: You could plead not guilty by reason of insanity on my part.  "The bitch was crazy, your Honor!"  The judge will let you off the hook and then invite you out for a beer so he can complain to you about his ex-wife and rebellious daughter.

And don't even think about invoking the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I'm not falling for that one again. / PANEL 3: / Faye: I have no idea what either of you are talking about. / Marten: To be honest, I'm not sure either. But every time Pintsize goes to a party he comes home late reeking of WD-40 and slurring together quantum physics technology. I think it's the AnthroPC equivalent of getting stoned and listening to Radiohead. / Pintsize: Thom Yorke has an AnthroPC. It only listens to French pop and Rush. They hate each other. / PANEL 4: / Faye: Wow, I think I just hit the point where nothing he does will ever surprise me again. Being that jaded feels very strange. / Marten: Don't say that, he regards it as a challenge. He'll probably pop out of the closet tomorrow, screaming Pavement lyrics and whacking himself in the head with an electric toothbrush. / Pintsize: Shit, they're onto me!

Dora: How's Ellen doing? / Faye: I...I don't really know! / Dora: What do you mean you don't know? / Faye: Look, you go talk to her. You'll see what I mean. / Dora: Ellen, sweetie, you okay? Do you want to talk things over some more? / Ellen: No, I think I'm pretty much over it. / Dora: Honey, it's okay if you're still upset. You don't have to pretend you're not. / Ellen: No, really! I'm not pretending. I feel much better. / Dora: Are...are you sure? I mean, you were in hysterics like five minutes ago. / Ellen: Well, I figure at this point I can either move on with my life or develop a creepy, obsessive fixation on Steve, and there's no WAY I'd have time to stalk him with my current course load. / Faye: Aw, that's no fun. If a boy breaks your heart you have to make him regret it! The quickest way to a man's heart really is through his stomach, because then you don't have to chop through that pesky rib cage.

I should download this for Marten, it'd make him happy. May I? / Dora: Huh? Yeah, sure. / Dora: Who do you think leaks these bands' albums before they're officially released, anyway? People at the record company? The bands themselves? / Faye: Machine elves travel into the near future with iPods, buy the records and then travel back to the present to leak them online. / [[Dora draws "skela-bunny" on the chalkboard]] {{Evidently, Dora is loeft-handed}} / Dora: Ah, I see. Marty McFly wasn't trying to save the world so much as improve his BitTorrent ratio. / Faye: If you're in a DeLorean traveling faster than the speed of light and the Killers are playing on the stereo, do they still suck? / Raven: Hey, I like the Killers! / Faye: Ssh, don't say that aloud! They might hear you and make another terrible album! / Dora: One day all these cookie-cutter New-Wave ripoff bands are going to combine Voltron-style into a giant Mecha Ian Curtis and destroy downtown London. NME will give their rampage a 9 our of 10.

[[Marten walks into the coffee of Doom]] / Faye: There you are. What took you so long? How's Captain Assyface? / Marten: You mean Steve? He's sleeping off the effects of what I'm pretty sure was enough alcohol to pickle a sperm whale. / Faye: Well, I hope he wakes up with a giant squid attacking his face, or an equivalent hangover. / Marten: Hey Ellen, how are you doing? / Ellen: Oh, much better. Is Steve okay? / [[Ellen's top read: SMIF COLLEGE]] / Marten: Uh, yeah. He was pretty upset about what happened, and it's probably not my place to get involved, but I think you two should-- / Ellen: Oh, I was upset too. But the more I think about it the more certain I am that it's all for the best. / Ellen: So, Marty...Now that I'm on the market again... / Marten: Uh...yes? / Ellen: Do you have any other cute guy friends you could introduce me to? / Dora: Heh, she has no idea how close to death she just came. / [[Faye, two inches from the back of Ellen's neck]] / Faye: I.

Faye: After that, it was all pretty much a blur. I don't remember much of the funeral. I'd be walking around town and see people who knew dad, and notice the way they looked at me and whispered when they thought I wasn't looking. I knew that should have bothered me, but I didn't really feel anything. It was like someone took out my brain and replaced it with a down pillow.

It was raining and I was looking at my hands on the steering wheel and I remembered dad teaching me how to drive- you know, the whole "hands at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock thing"- and all of a sudden it hit me.

Then their ambulance exploded and a bear tried to sexually assault me. The bear was also on fire, form the ambulance explosion. Then the UFOs came, and revealed that the Illuminati was really behind my father's suicide. / Marten: You've...you've got to be kidding.  / Faye: Hey, this is just what I remember.

I didn't get out of a hospital bed for a couple weeks, and then they had me under observation in the psychiatric ward for a month after that, since I was basically unable to function and there was some question as the whether the car accident was intentional or not. / Faye: I never did finish college, did I ever tell you that? / Marten: No, I remember you talking about your major, but... / Faye: Yeah. This was the summer between somphmore and junior year. I never went back. I was in the hospital pretty much all summer, and when I got out I just stayed home when I wasn't at my therapist. / Marten: Wow, so that must have been like... / Faye: Two years, give or take. It took a LONG time to get to the point where I wasn't having constant panic attacks or dissociative episodes. They tried all kinds of medication on me, but it mostly did more harm than good. Eventually I got to the point where I felt like I could at least function in society without going to crazy and killing myself. There was nothing for me down south, though. Just people who remembered my father and things that reminded me of him. So that's when I decided to come up here. / Faye: And that's pretty much it. That's my story. The whole sad truth of it. / Marten: Wow, Faye. I'm...I'm going to sit here and look thoughtful until I can come up with something to say that doesn't make me sound like a total fucking idiot. / Faye: That time would be better spent getting me a box of tissues and some juice. I'm snottier than a 13 year old girl and more dehydrated than Joan Rivers' hoo-ha.

Marten: So...I guess I can understand why you don't want to be in a romantic relationship with me. / Faye: No, Marten. It's not that I don't WANT to be. It's that I know I can't do it right now. / Faye: Therapy helped, but it's the equivalent of breaking your leg - you can walk when you get out of physical therapy, but you can't run a marathon right away. I can function as a human being right now, and even have friends, but I can't handle a relationship. The sad truth is that no matter how much you love someone, how much you trust them, there's no way you know for sure they won't decide to remove themselves from your life someday. I can't handle that fact like a rational human being right now. I want to, Jesus Christ I do wish I could, but I can't. / Faye: I think I might be able to, someday, but I don't know for sure. And it isn't fair of me to make you wait. / Marten: But what if I WANT to- / Faye: Marten, think about what you're saying. I don't know when, or if, I'll ever be able to have a successful relationship with another person. I can't promise you the promises you deserve. Promises get broken. / Marten: Couldn't we just make out now and worry about everything else later? / Faye: Sure, if you want to trade one night of fun for me freaking out, running away, and never coming back. / Marten: Well shit. I was almost letting myself hope that you'd be all "man, it sure feels good to get that off my chest! Let's go have sex!" / Faye: If trauma were that easily dealt with, psychologists would work pro bono.

1 / Marten: All right, it's my turn to talk now. / Faye: Okay, I'm listening. / Marten: If you'll take steps to get yourself fixed up- I mean more therapy, medication, whatever it takes, I'll do my best to treat you as a friend and not a girlfriend-in-waiting. / Faye: No, that's bullshit.  Why would you want me to get better if you weren't planning on waiting for me so we could date? / 2 / Marten: Because I CARE about you, dammit.  What you're doing right now isn't healiing, it's stasis.  If I have to have you as a friend and not a girlfriend, I'd rather at least have you as a HAPPY friend.

But i will try my BEST not to keep my romantic life in a holding pattern while you try to get yourself back on track. / 3 / Marten: And if, sometime in the future, you happen to be ready for a relationship and I happen to be available...no, let's just leave it at that for now.

I should probably go to bed. / Marten: Yeah, me too. / Faye: And by "go to bed" I mean "sob into my pillow until I pass out from exhaustion". / Marten: By "me too" I meant "wallow in crushing disappointment and self-pity." / Faye: Okay maybe we're being a little too honest with each other here. / Marten: Yeah, I think you're right.

Thank God you're finally awake! Faye shut me in here like three hours ago! / Marten: Why did she do that? / Pintsize: I'm pretty sure it was it was either asking her whether you two got it on last night after I went to sleep, or the obscene hip gyrations that accompanied my query. Now help me out of here. / Pintsize: Hey! / Marten: Mmm, waffles.

At ten in the evening. / Dora: We should go rescue her from her compulsion. / [[Vacuuming continues]] / Faye: Hmm, maybe if we drag her down here she'll start cleaning the apartment for me. / Dora: You're awful. / Faye: I'm not awful, I just believe that neuroses should be put to constructive use. / [[Vacuuming continues]] / Dora: I'm trying to think of a constructive use for YOUR psychological problems and all I can think of is "makes other women look saner by comparison". / Faye: Hmph. It's also a very efficient method of birth control and STD protection. / Dora: For you and Marten both. / Faye: Thpppt

Dora: Faye, I'm so sorry about all of this.  Can we still be friends? / Faye: Do you still want to date Marty? / Dora: I...I do, but if you don't want me to I'd rather be disappointed by that than have you hate me. / Faye: I won't hate you, as long as you treat him right and don't steal him away entirely.  I need you guys; you're my friends.  As long as you don't abandon me, I won't abandon you. / Dora: You know, you're honestly handling this a lot better than I was expecting.  Are you SURE you're okay? / Faye: I've been better, but I'll manage.  I do think I might go home to Savannah for a couple days.  Get some space and perspective on all this.  Visit my mom and sis, see if I can't put some old ghosts to rest.  Would that be okay with you?  I mean, with work and all? / Dora: Yeah, of course.  Raven and I can handle things while you're away. / Faye: So...one last question. / Dora: Yeah? / Faye: Is Marten a good kisser? / Dora: He's pretty good.  I mean, he's not one of those dudes who tries to stick their tongue down your throat, he's very...uh...goddamnit it feels really weird to be discussing this with you. / Faye: Haha, doesn't it?  It's like talkin' about blowjobs with your mom. / Dora: Please never use those two words in the same sentence ever again.

Faye: Well, off to work I go. / Martyn: Promise you and Dora won't murder each other? / Faye: If I don't get some espresso in me within the next ten minutes I cannot be held responsible for my actions. / Martyn: Fair enough. I'll see you later. / Faye: Hey, Marty...I think I'm gonna go home for a couple of days. I found a relatively cheap flight to Savannah for tomorrow morning. / Martyn: Is this because of what went down last night? / Faye: Well aren't we being assertive all of a sudden! Yeah, I decided this last night while I was talking to Dora. I just need a couple of days to regroup, and you two need couple days without me meddling in your affairs anyway. / Martyn: Okay, but you're...you're coming back, right? / Faye: Yeah, I'll come back.

Sherman didn't burn the city and I'm not gonna let you do it either. / Martyn: Where have you been lately anyway, Pintsize? / Pintsize: Mexico. At least, I think it was Mexico.

Dora: Hey sweetie! I missed you yesterday. / Marten: Hey Dora. I missed you too. / Dora: So Faye’s out of town? / Marten: Yep. I saw her off at like five this morning. / Dora: Any more shocking revelations or last-minute makeouts? / Marten: Huh? No, she just headbutted me.

Suave dudes always smell like aftershave and Old Spice. It’s pretty gross. / Raven: I like how Axe body spray smells, but it doesn’t make me want to hump inanimate objects like in the commercials. Which is sort of disappointing.

Are you kidding? I'm friggin' basking in the moment. / Dora: I hate to interrupt your basking, but the waitress is here. / Waitress: It's okay, I'm used to it. Do you have any idea how often I overhear this conversation.

The way I see it you gave Faye as much time as she was willing to take, you know?

Now if you'll excuse me I have to go undo your handiwork. / Marten: You all right, Hannelore? / Dora: I was wondering whether your carpet matches your drapes, but Marten wouldn't let me peek. / Hannelore: I'm fine, and hardwood floors are much easier to keep clean than carpeting. / Dora: Hahaha, touche.  Would that make a RealDoll linoleum? / Hannelore: We should be thankful that they exist.

Number 634: I Hate Thursdays
Dora: God, I had the WEIRDEST sex dream last night. / Marten: This wasn't the one with me dressed like Badtz Maru again, was it? / Hannelore: I had a sexy dream about that TV detective "Monk" once. I mean, I guess it wasn't that SEXY, we just straightened up his apartment together. In the nude. / Dora: Okay, so mine pales in comparison to Hannelore's little subconscious acid trip, but anyway I was making out with Mark McGwire in a solid-gold jacuzzi on the moon. I don't even like baseball! / Marten: Great, now I have to compete with Mark Friggin' McGwire for your affections? Dude could pick me up and use me to hit home runs! / Dora: Don't worry honey, my subconscious is a fickle vixen. Next week she'll be crushing on Watne Gretzky or something. / Marten: That's still better than MY subconscious, apparently. / Hannelore: How so? / Marten: A couple weeks ago I had a dream that I was having sex with a chair. A big, comfy, leather-upholstered chair. The really freaky part was how GOOD it felt. It was some of the best dream-sex I've ever had. / Dora: Hm. I have a vinyl catsuit in the closet that could pass for upholstery... / Faye: Okay, I'm going back into the bathroom until you guys are done having this conversation. / Hannelore: Are you going to be cowering? Can I join you?

{{Title: Number 699: Pressganging}} / [[Dora, Marten, Faye and Penelope in Coffee of Doom]] / Dora: So, you want the job, Pizza Girl?  I'm sure we could bend your superpowers to use in the coffee realm. / Penelope: I told you I am NOT Pizza Girl! / Marten: You know, maybe she isn't.  The resemblance is striking, but... / Faye: No, see, this is all part of her act.  She has to protect her secret identity as...uh... / Penelope: My NAME is Penelope Gaines. / Faye: Penelope Gaines!  Even the initials are the same! / Marten: Why would Pizza Girl need a secret identity?  I can't imagine that her life would be in danger if people knew who she really was. / Dora: Yeah, but then she'd have stoned dudes callin' at all hours demanding deep-dish.  Doesn't sound very pleasant to me. / Marten: Hmm, point taken. / Faye: Okay "Penelope," how'd you like to work with us?  We could use another employee and it'd be good cover for you. / Penelope: I already have a job!  I work at a bookstore! / Faye: Oh come on, the whole mild-mannered secret identity thing is SO Golden Age Marvel.  Get with the times!  Sass it up!  Join us! / Penelope: Wha...I...Ju...you people are INSANE! / Dora: No crazier than someone who runs around in a red vinyl jumpsuit in her spare time.  C'mon, I'll show you how to run the espresso machine. / Marten: Wow, I've never heard of anybody being shanghaied into working at a coffee shop before.

Marten: Pintsize, I'm home! / Pintsize: Marten! Thank God, for a second I thought you were Hannelore's Roomba come to finish me off. / Marten: ...I don't think I want to know. Anyway I got another job. / Pintsize: Hooray! I will continue to be supplied with delicious alternating current. / Pintsize: So is the new job anything cool? Wrestling alligators, or training bears to wrestle alligators? / Marten: Nope, I'm just gonna be working over at the Smif library. / Pintsize: The all-girls college? Maybe you'll get to wrestle some chicks then! / Marten: I doubt their late-book-return policy is THAT strict. / Pintsize: Hey, I've seen movies about all-girl colleges. Practically all they DO is wrestle. Naked. / Marten: Okay, no more late-night HBO for you.

Number 702: All The Engineers In The House Say Heyo
[[Dora and Faye in Coffee of Doom.]] / Faye: So, wanna take bets on whether Penelope will show up tomorrow morning?  I give it two to one odds. / Dora: That good, huh?  We were awfully hard on her. / Faye: Ah, but I also threatened to burn her house down if she DIDN'T show up. / Dora: Great, so now we're a protection racket as well as a coffee shop. / Faye: Hey, uh...about earlier.  I'm sorry. / Dora: Hm? / Faye: It's none of my business what you and Marty do when I'm not around.  I'm just... trying to get used to that, and sometimes it's hard. / Dora: It's okay, Faye.  It's hard for me sometimes too.  I still feel bad about pouncing on him so soon.  And I worry that I'm just, like, your surrogate or something. / Faye: No offense Dora, but you'd make a *lousy* surrogate for me.  You're like .65 Fayes at best. / Dora: I wasn't aware you were a unit of measure. / Faye: It's a complex formula involving cup size, body fat percentage, and an enumerated index of psychological issues. / Dora: Engineers rejoice! Science has finally found a use for the slide rule in the realm of romance!

Hannelore: Winslow, you have PLENTY of purpose!  You keep me company, you can do all kinds of computery things like run programs and play music... / Winslow: Oh!  Okay, I feel much better now. / Marten: Heh, you AnthroPCs have it easy.  Us humans have been tryin' to figure out our purpose for thousands of years now. / Winslow: As far as I can tell, your genetic imperatives are mating and killing each other. / Marten: Heh, yeah pretty much. / Hannelore: It's all genetics.  We wanna mate so we can raise children, and we fight because we want our children to have the most resources. / Marten: And it's self-selecting, too.  People who choose not to listen to those primordial instincts necessarily remove themselves from the gene pool. / Hannelore: I don't think it's that simple.  Individuals who don't reproduce themselves can still affect to the gene pool by helping raise others' offspring. / Winslow: See, you're still just trying to ensure the survival of the species.  Heck, what's the most intimate thing humans do together?  Mate!  Even if you're not trying to reproduce, you're still doing what your genes want you to do. / Marten:  So you're basically saying that we're all just automatons following programs encoded in our genes? / Winslow: No, you make everything WAY too complicated for it to be pure instinct.  Dating?  Flowers?  MYSPACE?  I mean, come on. / Hannelore:  Haha!  "Interests: Sports, video games, fulfilling genetic imperatives by stickin' my wee-wee in some vaginas."

It's so florid and overwrought, like a Meatloaf album in printed form.

Or are you just realphabetizing your bookshelf. / Penelope:  What if I WAS just realphabetizing my bookshelf?  Is that activity inherently INFERIOR to going on a date with someone?  I get so SICK of people looking at me like I'm INSANE when I tell them I'm not dating anybody and not looking to.  As if the entirety of my worth as a person is tied into whether I'm dating someone.  And popular culture just reinforces this!  TV shows that are medical dramas in name but really nothing more than sexy doctors kissing sexy nurses.  Emo bands that obsess over breakups and glorify the self-pitying single guy.  And the dating shows!  Don't even get me STARTED on the dating shows.  Everything is just one big subliminal message that says "if you are not in a relationship then your life is devoid of meaning." / Faye:  My God, it all makes sense now.  The entirety of our culture is a vast conspiracy manufactured by the diamond cartels.  The DeBeers corporation has subverted humanity's genetic drive to reproduce so we'll buy more jewelry. / Penelope:  That's what I keep trying to TELL people, but they always revert my edits to the DeBeers WikiPedia entry.

Yeah, it was. / Ellen: Well, I'm... I'm sorry. It was way out of line comparing my situation with yours. I know it's not the same thing. I was wrong and I'm sorry. / Marten: Why'd you REALLY break up with Steve, anyway? / Ellen: I'm gonna be gone on a boat for a semester! I'm not ready to do the long-distance thing. I just thought it'd be less painful in the long run if I ended the relationship when I did. / Ellen: I still feel bad about it. I mean, I think I made the right decision for me, but I wish it hadn't gone the way it did. / Marten: And the guy you were going on a date with the next day? How's he fit into all of this? / Ellen: That was just a big mistake. I dunno, I guess it was like, I had already drunk three quarters of the bottle of Mistake Whiskey, so I figured I might as well finish the whole thing since I was gonna feel shitty the next morning anyway. / Marten: The hangover is the worst part of Mistake Whiskey, though. Instead of caffeine and aspirin you need distance and perspective and they don't sell those at the drugstore.

Faye: So what's the deal with you "only dating blondes"? / Sven: It's not that I won't DATE girls who aren't blond. It's just that I PREFER blondes. And I can afford to be pretty picky about who I sleep with, so it mostly ends up being blond chicks. / Faye: What a delightfully arbitrary, egotistic standard to hold others to. / Sven: How is that any more arbitrary than your standards? You tend to be attracted to skinny indie-rock dudes, right? / Faye: Your point being? / Sven: It's not that you won't DATE dudes who don't fit that template, but that's the portion of the population you're initially most attracted to. / Sven: And yeah, it might be egotistic for me to say that I can get the girls pretty easily, but it's also mostly true in my experience. So why wouldn't I apply my standards to those girls I try and get? / Faye: So what's the rest of your standard-set look like? "Blond, dumb, hot, and willing to put out on the first date?" / Sven: Hey! I've dated plenty of smart girls! / Faye: Okay, replace "dumb" with "gullible". / Sven: I... uh... okay, I'll give you that one. Why is it the more I talk to you the more I feel like a misogynist prick? / Faye: It's my mutant superpower. I was bitten by a radioactive Ani DiFranco. / Sven: Ooh, that's another one of my rules. No Ani DiFranco fans.

I want to kiss boys, but I'm afraid of kissing boys, but I want to kiss boys, blah blah blah blah. / Doctor: I think one thing you should try to keep in mind is that not every man on the planet is your father. They're not all going to abandon you like he did, and certainly not in such a hurtful fashion. / Faye: Well I KNOW that. but convincing my subconcious is something else entirely. / Faye: Besides, what if I take the plunge, get involved with some guy, and he DOES turn out to be a jerk, or leaves me in the dust or whatever? / Doctor: Well, that's the inherent risk of relationships, isn't it? And when it happens, you just have to get up, dust yourself off, and try again. The thing is, you're still in the getting-up and dusting-off stages regarding your father's death. Your relationship with your father and your love life obviously aren't the same thing, but until you can come to terms with your father's death and mentally separate that very real loss from potential losses in your future, it'll be hard for you to maintain a healthy romantic relationship with someone. / [[Faye lies down on the sofa.]] / Faye: Well crap. Part of me was hoping you'd tell me I just needed to go out and bang some dude. / Doctor: "Just go out and band some dude" is one of the phrases you will never heard a psychiatrist say.

Take your money and go, o mighty wielder of foil sack and Honda Civic. / Penelope:  Didn't think of that possibility, huh. / Faye:  I was so caught up in my own craftiness I failed to see the glaring flaws in my plan. / Dora:  And *I* didn't say anything because I wanted you to feel dumb for putting Penny on the spot like that.  We shouldn't pry into her personal life, Faye. / Faye:  Oh don't you even DARE act self-righteous!  You were all "ooh, what a good idea!  We should TOTALLY do that" before Penny came in today! / Dora:  I... I was overcome by the Imp of the Perverse!

Dora: Really though Penelope, I do apologize. I WAS rude of us to pry. / Faye: We're just tryin' to get you to come outta your shell a little. / Penelope: I'm not IN my shell! I'm right here! / Faye: Okayyy, so what do you do in your spare time? / Penelope: I, uh read a lot of books. / Faye: Oh yeah? What's your favourite genre? / Penelope: Um, history I guess? But I read all sorts of stuff. Novels, classic literature, science fiction, fantasy... / Faye: Do you have a special man in your life? A lucky fellow who really stocks your shelf, so to speak? / Penelope: No... I dated this one guy for like three years, but it didn't work out. / Dora: Ooh, I'm sorry hon, Bad break up? / Penelope: Yeah, it turned out he was secrectly an agent of my arch-nemesis, Doctor Caizoni. He betrayed me at the worst possible moment, and I was forced to kill him with a giant peperroni. / Faye: Okay, she really isn't Pizza Girl. A real superheroine wouldn't take such pleasure in messing with people's heads unless that's what she WANTS me to think! Arrgh! / Dora: Deceit within deceit! She may not be Pizza Girl but she'd make a damn fine Harkonnen.

Panel 1 / Marten: ...So now Dora and Faye are kind of obsessed with finding out what your secret pastime is. / Tai: Well I'm certainly not telling THEM. It's way too embarassing. / Panel 2 / Marten: I won't deny that I'm curious, but you don't have to tell me. Just promise me you don't do horse porn or something horrible like that. / Tai: Eww! No I do not have SEX with HORSES. It's... ah, screw it. I should just tell you. Promise you won't make fun of me? / Marten: Scout's honor. / Panel 3 / Tai: It's called "FlashLARP PotterSpace." Basically a whole bunch of people congregate at a predetermined public location, act out scenes from the Harry Potter universe using foam weapons, and then disperse. We post videos of the events to a MySpace page for the group. Everybody goes by an alias to maintain the mystique and prevent legal repercussions. It's part roleplaying, part performance art, and part public disruption. / Panel 4 / Marten: That's... that's the nerdiest thing I've ever heard of. / Tai: Actually, the cosplay crossover subgroup is even worse. You haven't seen true geekdom until you've watched Snape and Sephiroth face off in a duel to the death in front of a crowd of bewildered mall patrons.

Number 815: Interspecies Dialogue
Marten: So how're things going with your, uh, girlfriends? / Tai: Eh, complicated as usual. Ashley wants to be exclusive with me, which obviously has Serena hurt and pissed off, so Ash and I have been getting together on the down-low and hoping Serena doesn't catch on.  / Marten: So you're happy with Ashley? / Tai: Yeah, I mean I don't really see it lasting, but the sex is good and we get along okay. / Marten: Do you think she feels the same way? I mean, she broke up your little threesome arrangement to date you exclusively. / Tai: I think that was more a matter of physics than emotional attachment. / Marten: How so? / Tai: Have you SEEN the beds they give us here? It's hard enough just getting three people IN one of them, let alone doing sexy things. And believe me, the novelty of sex-inflicted rug burn wears off really fast. / Marten: Your problems are utterly alien to me. It's like a bear complaining to a shark that its knees hurt.

Number 816: Friggin' Architecture
[[Steve and Marten are walking outdoors.]] / Marten: So how're you doing, dude? / Steve: I dunno man, I just been bummed out lately. Ever since Ellen dumped me, it's like what's the point of even trying? / Marten: Wow, you're that depressed? / Steve: Not really DEPRESSED, just sorta burnt out on dating. Like, I see a hot chick and instead of thinking "oh man I wanna bang her" I think "meh, we'd probably just break up eventually." / Marten: I dunno, if you tried dating girls based on mutual interests instead of just that initial physical attraction, maybe things would work out better. / Marten: I mean you an Ellen didn't exactly have a lot in common.  / Steve: Sure, but what exactly ARE my interests? My life basically consists of going to work at my nondescript office job, playing video games, and getting drunk with my friends.  / Marten: Well, you just need to meet a girl who's as boring as you are! Your ideal lady works as a telemarketer, goes to a knitting class once a week, and considers Ladies' Night at the nearest bar to be the height of social interaction. / Marten: She has three cats. They are all named after characters from Jane Austen books.  / Steve: Thanks Marten, she sounds delightful. I might as well go to the morgue to pick up chicks from now on.

Nice to meet you. / Penelope: Nice to meet you and your sideburns. / Steve: {{Touching his sideburns}} Haha, thanks. I sorta grew 'em out as a joke. / Penelope: If you're gonna grow them out that far, you might as well go for the full Abe Lincoln chinstrap. Ladies love the Amish look / Steve: {{Leaving and waving}} Speaking of which, I'm late for a barn-raising so I better get going. See you kids later. Nice meeting you Penelope. / Marten: Uh, okay, bye Steve. / Penelope: {{Waving at Steve}} Nice meeting you too! / Marten: He...he walked away from a chick who was openly flirting with him. Steve is having a psychotic break. / Penelope: I wasn't FLIRTING! He said I was pretty so I was nice to him in return! That's basic common courtesy, not flirting! / Dora: Settle down honey, you'll rumple your mating plumage.

Winslow, hop to it. / Winslow: Yes ma'am! / [[Winslow addresses espresso machine]] / Winslow: Hi there!  I'm Winslow!  What's your name? / Winslow: Hello?  Mister espresso machine? / Winslow: It's, um, it's not saying anything. / Marten: It's an espresso machine.  It can't talk. / Winslow: Why not? / Hannelore: It's not a computer.  It doesn't have any intelligence. / Winslow: Well THERE'S your problem.  Why the heck do people still use machines that can't think? / Hannelore: Winslow, don't be racist!  Non-sentient machines can still lead perfectly productive lives in modern society. / Marten: A lot of things are better off non-sentient anyway.  Can you imagine the kind of counseling self-aware nuclear weapons would need?

[[Coffee of Doom, Marten, Hannelore and Winslow. Marten is tasting coffee. Specials "Hang on hang on dangit"]] / Hannelore: How's the coffee? Did we get it right? / Marten: It's not as good as Dora's, but I think we can serve this to people without poisoning them, anyway. / Winslow: Hooray for Google! / Customer: Hey, could I get a large latte? / Hannelore: Have you washed your hands recently? / Customer: Huh? Um, no... / Hannelore: Well, go wash 'em then. / Customer: What? But- / Hannelore: No buts! I won't serve coffee to someone with filthy hands! / Customer: Okay! Okay! / Customer: There, they're clean. Are you happy now? Can I please order my coffee? / Hannelore: Depends. Did you bring your toothbrush and toothpaste? I can't serve coffee to someone who isn't going to brush their teeth immediately afterwards. Coffee stains! / Customer: Wh-I-no! Nevermind! You're friggin' crazy! / Hannelore: Well YOU have BAD HYGIENE! / Hannelore: I think I'm beginning to understand why Faye is so surly all the time. Honestly, the nerve of some of these people! / Marten: We should put a sign out front. "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Dental Floss, No Service."

[[Faye, Dora and Penelope are coming hot of the showers wrapped in towers. A sign pointing to the left says "steam room"]] / Faye: Whew! I am gonna be SORE tomorrow. I haven't run that hard since high school. / Penelope: You shouldn't push yourself so hard if you haven't worked out in a while. It's a good way to end up hurting yourself. / [[Only Dora and Penelope are visible as they get to their lockers]] / Dora: Heh, the only thing that hurts is my pride. / Penelope: So you didn't let her win? / Dora: Nope, she beat me fair and square.  / [[Dora is in her bra and we see the top of her panties' waistband, Penelope is looking away, her face is red and she looks embarassed. She already has her clothes on.]] / Dora: So hey, how much is a membership here? I should probably work out more often, if a half hour on the threadmill is enough to wipe me out.  / Penelope: It's, uh...it's like forty bucks... / [[Penelope still is red and looking embarassed]] / Dora: What's with the embarassed expression? / Penelope: I, uh...do you think you could put your pants on? Its kind of making me uncomfortable. / Dora: Sheesh, don't tell me you get weirded out seeing another woman in her underwear. You're as much of a prude as Faye! / [[Dora's back is now exposed at a 3/4 angle, displaying her flames tattoo and a string]] / Penelope: It's not that you're in your underpants, it's thay you're in those specific underpants. They...don't exactly leave much to the imagination. / Dora: Oh. Right. Sorry. I was running low on clean panties and had to delve into the "special occasions" drawer. / Penelope: "Special occasions?" I am so not coming to your birthday party.

Oh God, have you been here by yourself the whole time? I'm so sorry! / Marten: It's cool, Hannelore came over to help me figure out the espresso machine. She's in back washing her hands again. / Dora: Oh yeah? So you can make me coffee when I'm feeling too lazy to do it myself now, huh? / Marten: Damn straight! I'm an espresso pro! Here, lemme make you a latte. / Dora: Heheh, okay. / Marten: Well? What do you think? / Dora: Did...did you actually serve this to our customers? / Marten: Yeah, why? Is it that bad? / Dora: Honey, I love you and all but this is the second-worst latte I have ever tasted. / Marten: Wow. What was the very worst? / Dora: Faye "brewed" some potting soil instead of coffee grounds. / Faye: Turns out hippies will drink anything if you tell 'em it's "100% organic."

I'll see you guys later. / Dora: Suit yourself. / [[Walking around at night]] / Marten: So, did you really mean what you said earlier? / Dora: About what? / Marten: When you said you love me and all." / Dora: Of course! You make me happy! / Marten: It's just, you've never said that before. / Dora: What're you talking about? I've said it a bunch of times while we've fooled around and stuff. / Marten: Oh, well I didn't realize you really MEANT it those times. / Dora: What do you mean? / Marten: I just figured I was so good in the sack it reduced you to incoherency and you didn't realize what you were saying. / Dora: Hah.

You seem nervous. / Marten: Huh? Oh, uh, no, it's nothing... / Dora: Are you freaked out 'cause I said I love you? / Marten: No, I'm just...I feel bad because I wanna say I love you too, but when I think about it I start wondering "well what exactly do I mean when I say 'love' anyway" and then I just start second-guessing myself and get all confused. I'm sorry.  / Dora: You're over-thinking it, honey. You make me happy, we get along well, and I don't want this relationship to end anytime soon. When I think about you, it makes me smile. For me, that's love.  / Marten: Well, I feel the same way! I guess I'm just worried that I'm doing it wrong or something. Like, it feels too simple. / [[Waiter brings them their dinner.]] / [[Dora and Marten eat dinner.]] / Dora: Not everything has to be complicated, sweetie. Sometimes the best things in life are the simplest.  / Marten: Yeah, I guess that's true. I mean, look at the Fender Telecaster- you don't get much simpler as far as guitars go, and they're still totally awesome. / Dora: Hah. "Everything I know about relationships I learned from Leo Fender."

I was just playing Uno with Pintsize. / Pintsize: She would't agree to strip poker. / [[Faye is sitting on the couch besides Hanners and opening the ice cream container]] / Faye: So how was your day? / Hannelore: It was fun! I finished the project my mom gave me and then helped Marten out at the coffee shop. How about you? / Faye: Well, Doctor Corrinne says I gotta qui drinkin', and I busted my ass at the gym today so I think I've earned myself this pint of ice cream.  / Hannelore: But doesn't eating that kind of negate working out? / Faye: Whatever. I don't mind having a luscious bottom, it's having a lush's bottom I'm trying to avoid. / [[Silent panel, no reaction]] / Faye: "Lush" is a slang term for someone who drinks too muck. Luscious, lush's...they sound alike. / Hannelore: Oh! It was a pun! I'm sorryl. Daddy didn't allow puns when I was growing up. / Pintsize: Because in space, no one can hear you groan.

My poor stomach. / Marten: What're you doing? / Faye: Playing reverse strip poker. / Dora: What, you put ON clothes if you lose a hand? / [[Faye has normal clothing on, Hannelore a few shirts and a tuque, Pintsize is burrowed in clothing]] / Faye: Exactly! The game gets progressively more difficult as the layers pile up. / Marten: I...I see. / Hannelore: I wish I were better at bluffing. I have to re-wash all this stuff now. / Pintsize: I can't move! / Faye: I think this idea has real potential. Imagine if you applied the reversal concept to other games! / Dora: Would reverse drinking games involve vomiting, or enemas? Either way, count me out. / Marten: Reverse Hungry Hungry Hippos would be really insensitive to bulimics. / Hannelore: Wouldn't Reverse Monopoly just be a communist revolution?

Number 1009: More Gratuity
[[Marten's appartment, Marten is standing behind the couch taking shirts off Pintsize, Dora and Hanners sitting on the couch]] / Dora: So you finished that project for your mom? / Hannelore: Yeah, and I don't think she ended up killing anybody at the end, either! / Marten: That's...good. / Dora: What're you gonna do about all those boxes in your apartment? / Hannelore: Mom said she'd send some people by tomorrow to pick them up. / Marten: Also good. / [[Marten has taken a lot of shirts of Pintsize and is looking at him strangely]] / Hannelore: And then after that I have to vacuum and clean everything. Paper and cardboard are mold magnets.  / Dora: Have you ever thought about hiring a cleaning service? It'd probably save you a lot of time. / Marten: Jeez, how bad at poker ARE you? / Pintsize: I'm an aggressive better! / [[Pintsize only has pink panties left on]] / Hannelore: Oh, the cleaning services in this state stopped returning my calls a long time ago. / Dora: I...see. / Marten: Those couldn't possibly fit any girl I know, which implies that they're yours. / Pintsize: I like to feel pretty sometimes!

No! What on earth would make you think I'd even consider that?! / Marten: I'm sorry! I just thought that, y'know, robots don't have germs or anything... / Faye: Apparently HannerDad followed the same line of reasoning. What exactly does he do for a living, anyway? I mean, AnthroPCs are one thing, but you don't see fully humanoid robots running around everywhere. / Hannelore: He doesn't really do anything "for a living" at this point. He made all his money years ago. Now he basically just does whatever interests him. I guess he's been interested in robots lately.  / Faye: That's every father's fantasy, isn't it? Not only picking your daughter's suitors, but building them from scratch. / Marten: I wonder if he built a sexy female robot too. That's the first thing I'd do with that kind of technology. / Hannelore: Well, I'm sending it back to him. I don't want my first boyfriend to be made of plastic. / Faye: I dunno, I think the best kind of boyfriend is the one who lives in your underwear drawer and takes AA batteries.  / Marten: Don't get too excited, Faye. According to the manual those parts are "features to be implemented at a later date." / Marten: Poor guy. His bait and tackle are still in beta.

I can open jars! / Dora: I... I think I liked the old Winslow better. This one's kinda Uncanny Valley for my taste. / Winslow: Uncanny Valley? What's that? / Hannelore: That's when something artificial looks human but not quite human enough, and it's creepy. / Winslow: So... I'm creepy looking because I look too much like a human? / Dora: Kinda. I'm sorry! / [[Winslow removes his human looking face to reveal a metallic skull and jaw. Hannelore looks horrified and throws her arms in front of her face. Dora and Marten look disturbed.]] / Winslow: Is this better? / Hannelore: Aaaugh! No! / Dora: Great.

Guess who? / Pintsize: Aagh! W-Winslow?! / Winslow: Yep! / Pintsize: How come he gets a human body and I don't?! / Marten: Because if you had opposable thumbs you'd be a threat to civilization. / Pintsize: That's not fair! Monkeys have thumbs, and they're not a threat to civilization! / Marten: I dunno...monkeys always look like they know something we don't.  / Faye: Yeah, the taste of their own urine. / Pintsize: Actually, some people on the internet- / Hannelore: I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

It'd be creepy to leave it laying around my apartment. / Faye: Eh, not really. Everyone has a few robot exoskeletons in their closet. / Hannelore: That was a terrible joke. / Faye: I wasn't joking! We've got Pintsize's old chassis in our linen closet. / Marten: Yeah, I should really get rid of that thing one of these days. Maybe put it up on Freecycle or something. / Pintsize: No way! Some hippie will take my old body and turn it into a bong! / Faye: Yeah, nobody likes having smoke blown up their ass.  / Hannelore: Augh. Can we put her jokes up on Freecycle? / Marten: I'm not sure anybody would take them. You can't put a fancy slipcover on a stupid joke.

[[Faye and Dora are standing behind the counter at Coffee of Doom.]] / Faye: Sorry I'm late.  I had to help Marten defend Hanners at her inquisition. / Dora: I don't want to know, do I. / Faye: Probably not. / [[Sven approaches the counter]] / Sven: Hey Faye, maybe you can help me with this. / Faye; Gah!  What're you doing here? / Sven: Workin' on some song lyrics and drinking coffee.  Why do you always act so shocked to see me? / Faye: N-nevermind.  What's the song about? / [[Faye makes a cup of coffee.  Sven writes in a notepad.]] / Sven: It's about a guy who used to be a total horn-dog but is trying to clean up his act. / Faye: Gee, that sounds familiar.  You could title it "Thinly-Veiled Personal Metaphor Blues." / Sven: Hey, they say to write what you know. / [[Sven is holding a cup of coffee]] / Faye: If you really followed that advice you'd be doing porn soundtracks. / Sven: Hey, don't knock the porno music.  It's the ultimate form of ambient music.  Supremely ignorable, but still entertaining if you notice it.  Brian Eno would be proud. / Dora: Oh man, his Oblique Strategies cards are PERFECT for porn.  "Ask your body."  "Work at a different speed."  "Try faking it!"

[[Marten, Pintsize, Hannelore and Winslow, at Marten and Faye's apartment.

On whose authority?! / Marten: On MY authority. / Pintsize: Who died and made you king? / Marten [wiggling his thumbs]: Nobody. It's the Rule of Thumb. Whoever has the thumbs makes the rules. / Pintsize: Well...you know who else had thumbs? HITLER. / Marten: You did NOT just pull a Godwin's Law on this conversation. / Hannelore: I think the term you're looking for is "reductio ad Hitlerum." / Pintsize: You know who else knew Latin? The NAZIS. / Hannelore: Well you know who knew more Latin than the Nazis? INDIANA JONES. / Marten: This conversation proves that the only thing dumber than an argument on the Internet is the same argument in real life. / Winslow [with a cat face on his screen]: I'm a cat macro!

Sven: This song just isn't coming together like I wanted. What the hell rhymes with "philandering"? / Faye: Slandering, meandering... I'm guessing your target audience wouldn't know what that word means anyway. / Sven: I don't even have a good melody in my head. I shoulda brought my guitar with me. / Faye: Oh god, no way. No way at ALL. You do not want to be the guy with the acoustic guitar at the coffee shop. / Sven: Oh, I wouldn't be. I was gonna bring my Strat and Marshall half-stack. / Faye: So instead of the douchebag playing the Bob Dylan version of "All Along the Watchtower" you'd be the douchebag playing the Jimi Hendrix version? / Dora: You know, a Coffee of Doom house band could be a good idea. I wonder if Deathmøle knows how to play "The Girl from Ipanema".

Tai: You're certainly in a cheerful mood today.  What gives? / Marten: Tonight's the first time I get to try out my new guitar at band practice.  I'm super-psyched. / Tai: Sweet.  I just got a cracked copy of the newest Abieton Live off the school network, so I'm gonna spend the night sequencing beats. / Marten: Oh, cool.  I didn't know you wrote music. / Tai: I just got started.  I don't really know what I'm doing, but I can at least make things go thoomp-thoomp-thoomp-thoomp with weird noises over top. / Marten: Haha.  Have you decided on a DJ name yet? / Tai: Yeah, "Tai Fighter."  I even made a logo! / Marten: Hahah! Nice! / Tai: So what would YOUR DJ name be? / Marten: I'd be DJ Awkwardd Beatz.  Instead of hi-hat my tracks would feature stammered apologies.  People would come to my shows to dance awkwardly while looking at their feet.  The mood-altering substance of choice would be anti-anxiety medication. / Tai: You could pioneer a whole new subgenre of mopey stress-core!

Number 1024: Feeding The Rule 34 Beast
Tai: Hey Marten, can you help me out with this survey I have to do for my modern sexuality class?  It's totally anonymous. / Marten: Okay. / Tai: Great. First question: Have you ever been sexually attracted to someone of your gender? / Marten: Not really. I mean, I could see it happening, but it just seems sort of...awkward. / Tai: Awkward? How so? / Marten: I dunno. I feel like if I ever had sex with a dude, the urge to high-five him in the middle of it would be overwhelming. / Tai: What? / Marten: You know, like "YEAH! WE'RE TOTALLY DOIN' IT! HIGH FIVE!" / Marten: Or like, when we're done, do that "jump in the air and bump chests" thing football players do after a big play. / Marten: A baseball-style butt-pat would be kinda redundant though. / Tai: Tell me, when you're having sex with Dora, do you get the urge to start singing soccer anthems? / Marten: No, sleeping with Dora is more like being in a post-match riot.

Steve, at table, looking scared.]] / Dave: Haha, not really.  You and Meena kept me up pretty late.  I could hear you guys all the way down the hall. / Steve: Y-you could?  What exactly did you, uh, hear? / [[Dave leaning against counter with glass of milk.  Steve at table still, with mug.  A red robot calendar hangs on the fridge.]] / Dave: The Laughing!  You really crack Meena up, y'know? / Steve: Oh, uh, sorry about that.  I'll try to be less witty after bedtime from now on. / Dave: Nah, it's cool.  I'm glad you guys get along so well.  After what happened between us, she deserves to be happy. / [[Dave, eyes open, looking skeptical.  Steve, surprised.]] / Steve: What exactly DID happen between you two? / Dave: Oh, she hasn't told you?  I'd really rather not say, then.  She should really be the one to tell the story. / Steve: Oh c'mon dude, you can't leave me hangin' like that. / Dave: I'm sorry, I just don't feel comfortable.  It's not my place. / [[Steve slightly exasperated.  Dave calm and composed.]] / Steve: C'mon, gimme a HINT or something.  Scale of one to ten- one being a big fight, ten being unplanned pregnancy. / Dave: Where would an STD fall on the scale? / Steve: What?! Oh shit, do I have to go get tested for something now? / Dave: No, no, I was just wondering.  I mean, I'd rather get someone pregnant than get syphilis.  I like babies!  Open sores, not so much. / {{title text: Copyright 2003-2007 J. Jacques}}

Meena: Hey cutie. You''re up early. / Steve: Yeah, I just, uh, woke up.  / Meena: Something wrong? / Steve: Why did you and Dave break up? According to him there's some kinda story behind it. / Meena: What? What did Dave tell you? / Steve: Not much. Just said he didn't "feel comfortable" telling me what happened, and that "you should be the one to tell the story." / Meena: Goddamnit. Do I have to tell you now? / Steve: No, but to be honest I'll probably worry about it until you do.  / Meena: All right, all right. I'll tell you after you finish your cereal.  / Steve: Why after? / Meena: Because if I tell you while you're still eating, I'm liable to get a faceful of milk and cheerios. / Steve: Like a spit-take? / Meena: No, like you throwing a bowl of cereal in my face. / Steve: I'd never do that! Domestic violence is wrong! And I really like Cheerios!

[[Meena and Steve sitting at Meena's kitchen table]] / Steve:  So what happened with you and Dave? / Meena:  I cheated on him.  I was out with some friends one night, got really drunk, and ended up going home with some random guy I met at a bar. / Steve:  Oh.  I...I can see how that might lead to a breakup. / Meena:  I know, right?  That was the worst part!  Dave forgave me!  I'm the one who ended the relationship. / Steve:  Wait, you cheated on him after, what, a four year relationship?  And he wasn't MAD? / Meena:  That's the thing.  Dave NEVER gets mad.  Nothing GETS to him!  He's like the ultimate Zen fucking master.  He was all "I'm very hurt by this, but everyone makes mistakes."  Then he smiled that stupid beatific smile of his and gave me a hug. / Meena, continuing:  Shit, that's half the reason I cheated on him in the first place!  Do you have any idea what it's like to date someone so PERFECT all the time?  He doesn't get mad.  He rarely makes mistakes, and when he does he immediately acknowledges them and does his best to fix it.  He remembers every birthday, every anniversary.  For fuck's sake, he's studying to be a DOCTOR because "he wants to help children." / Steve:  Holy shit.  He's a serial killer.  He has to be.  NOBODY's that perfect.  / Meena:  I used to worry that too.  He'd just get up and leave the house for a couple hours sometimes.  One time I followed him.  He was going to CHURCH.  He didn't tell me because he "didn't want to force his spiritual beliefs on me." / Steve:  Next you'll be telling me that he donates all his money to charities and spends twenty hours a week feeding the homeless. / Meena:  Only fifteen.  He has to sleep sometimes.

Like I can just be myself instead of trying to be Little Miss Perfect, you know? / Steve:  Sure, I understand. / [[Steve stands up]] / Steve:  Listen, I gotta get to work. / Meena:  Okay, thanks for not throwing your Cheerios at me. / Steve:  Thanks for being honest with me about the Dave situation. / [[Steve puts on his jacket and is leaving the kitchen, Meena looking around the wall]] / Meena:  I'll see you tonight then? / Steve:  Yeah, sure. / [[Steve turns around to find Dave in the living room, looking embarrassed]] / Steve:  Dave?!  I- I thought you went to class! / Dave:  I left my wallet here. / Steve:  Did you, uh, overhear all that? / Dave:  Most of it, yeah.  Sorry, I really didn't mean to eavesdrop. / Steve:  I don't...I don't really think you're a serial killer. / Dave:  That's good!  I don't think I am either. / Steve:  You don't think so? / Dave:  Well, if I really was crazy I might not know.  So I can't rule it out. / Steve:  Honesty isn't always the best policy, you know. / Dave:  Sorry.

[[Steve and Marten walking outdoors]] / Steve: ...So yeah. She totally wrecked her last relationship by bangin' around on a guy 'cause he was "too good for her." / Marten: And they still live together? Man, that is a weird situation. / Steve: Yeah, I dunno whether I should go with it, or just run like hell. / Marten: I dunno, past behaviour doesn't guarantee future action, y'know? It sounds like she's sorry about how evertything went down with Dave. You should give her a chance. I bet everything will work out fine. / Steve: Easy for you to say. Everything already worked out fine for you, mister I Have The Perfect Relationship. / Marten: Hey, my relationship isn't PERFECT! Dora and I*have problems just like every other couple. / [[They arrive at Coffee of Doom, Dora hands Marten a cookie. Her shirt says "Death"]] / Dora: Hey sweetie, I just baked you these cookies. You can take 'em to work and share with Tai. / Marten: Wow, you didn't have to... are those little icing drawings of you and me holding hand? / Dora: Aren't they cute? / Steve: What was that about you not having the perfect relationship again? / Marten: We're...we're not just holding hands in this one. / Dora: Oh. Yeah. That was Raven. You probably should't share that one with Tai. / Marten: Definitely not. Raven has some rather...grandiose ideas about my man-tackle.

Everybody's made a few relationship mistakes in the past. / Marten:  Yeah, it took me three or four girlfriends to figure out that you're not supposed to slap 'em on the ass in front of their parents. / [[Steve leaves]] / Dora:  If you did that in front of my dad, he'd crack up.  Then he'd break your arms. / Marten:  Now if I ever want six weeks' sick leave I know what to do. / Faye:  Your dad's a hypocrite.  He totally pinched me in my chub! / Dora:  Yeah, I meant to thank you for not brutalizing him. / Faye:  It happened too fast for me to react.  I get pinched, prepare to do murder, and turn around to see this jovial little Italian man offerin' me a handshake. / Marten:  How come you haven't introduced me to your folks yet, anyway? / Dora:  The last boy I brought home for dinner spent the entire time staring at my mom's boobs. / Marten:  Oh.  Is she, uh, well endowed in that area? / Dora:  They're...rather spectacular.  If you put my head on Heidi Klum's body, you'd be getting close. / Faye:  Heh.  Jovian cans for a jovial man.

They're always happy when I come to visit. / Marten: R-really? Oh. Ok. / Dora: Suddenly you sound less thrilled about the prospect of meeting my parents. / Marten: It's just a lot of pressure! Should I wear a button-down shirt? Do I need a haircut? / Dora: Just don't tell my parents about how you're putting yourself through school by dealing pot and you'll be fine. / [[Panel zooms out, Faye is standing behind counter]] / Marten: Oh man. Did a guy you were dating actually do that? / Dora: Yeah. That was Jerry. That was... awkward. / Faye: Like broken arms awkward? / Dora: No, like "dad buying weed from my boyfriend at the dinner-table" awkward. / Marten: Ooh, I can see how that'd be weird. / Dora: Yeah.

I want them to like me. / Tai:  I dunno why they wouldn't.  You've got an AWESOME job, after all.  Make sure you tell them about how witty, intelligent, and beautiful your boss is. / Marten:  Not to, uh, contradict you, but why are you so interested in Dora's parents knowing about YOU? / Tai:  In case Dora has a hot younger sister I could corrupt. / Marten:  Sorry, she doesn't. / Tai:  Well, tell them to get started on one, then!  I figure in 18 years or so I'll be ready to settle down into a nice comfy May/October relationship.

The wrist-grab means "we are using protection."  The last part where he grabbed my thumb indicates his tentative approval. / Dora:  What if he hadn't approved? / Marten:  I'd have a broken thumb.

I don't wanna do either. / Marten: Heheh. Actually this is my regular hair color. / Mrs. Bianchi: It reminds me of that bondage lady Dora has all the pictures of in her room. What's her name? Vera...Veronica... / Dora: Veronica Vance. / Mrs. Bianchi: Yes, that's it! She has the same hair and eyes. It's very unusual. / Marten: Yeah, it runs in the family.  / Mrs. Bianchi: I bet it does! You know Dora gets her hair and looks from me, and her brother Sven- have you met him? He gets his looks from Peter's brother Joseph, we think. Come, sit down, dinner's almost ready. / Dora: Wow, she didn't even pick up on it. / Marten: That's okay. I should probably save that particular revelation for post-dinner drinks anyway.

What is it you would really like to do? / Marten:  Well ideally I'd like to be a rock star.  But I'd settle for being able to do music full-time. / Dora:  I don't think you have a big enough ego to pull off rock stardom, honey.  You're also short several pairs of leather pants. / Peter:  Hah!  He could always borrow some'a yours. / Elssa:  Ugh, the leather pants.  So disgusting. / Marten:  Disgusting? / Elssa:  Dora would wear the same pair of leather pants in high school every day for days at a time, until I would have to yell at her to change out of them.

No, I slept with him. Twice. / Four today? Yeah, I can do that. Thanks. Bye. / Faye: Penny, can you hold the fort for an hour or so this afternoon?

And I'm all pouncin' on him like some kinda slut. / Corrine: Sexual attraction and romantic interest are two different things. Sleeping with one guy doesn't make you a slut. / Faye: I know, but... I don't DO this! I can't even DATE boys! / Corrine: It could be what you need isn't someone to DATE. / Faye: What, so I should just start bangin' any dude I'm attracted to? / Corrine: No, no. That's just swinging between two extremes. What I'm saying is that you had a casual sexual encounter with someone, and that can be a perfectly healthy experience. / Faye: Even if that "someone" is your boss-slash-friend's older brother? The same boss-slash-friend who's currently DATING your best friend and roommate,  who you totally shot down romantically? / Corrine: Hang on, hang on.

The Traditional
Dr. Corrinne: So the real question is, what is it exactly that has you all "freaked out?" / Faye: I...I don't know. I mean, when you rationally explain it, there's not much to be freaked out BY. "Oh I had sex with a boy, oooh, big deal." / Dr. Corrinne: But there's still a part of you that IS bothered by it. / Faye: Yeah. / Dr. Corrinne: Faye, I think one thing you need to learn is that the little voices in your head aren't always correct. Sometimes you really can just ignore them. The trick, of course, is knowing when to do that. But it's something you CAN learn, over time. / Faye: So... I shouldn't be upset over sleeping with Sven? / Dr. Corrinne: I don't think so. You moved a little faster than I'd have expected, but it's certainly nothing to worry about. / Faye: Really? / Dr. Corrinne: Really. / Faye: High five. / Dr. Corrinne: Pardon? / Faye: I got laid.

[[Dora and Marten, at her apartment]] / Dora: All right, all right. We can talk about things now. / Marten: Can we start with why you got so mad at me? / Dora: Honey, when a girl is already angry, telling her she's being irrational probably isn't the best way to calm her down. / Marten: Yeah, I realize that now. I just don't understand why it bothers you so much that Faye slept with your brother. / Dora: Because everything's always about HIM! Every other girl at school had a crush on him. Half my friends were just pretending they liked me so they could sneak up to his room and make out. / Dora: He was Mister Popular and I was just his weird little sister who had bad skin and wore too much black. / Dora: And he doesn't even have to TRY! He cruised through high school and college, he never studied and still got perfect grades. Meanwhile I'm busting my ass to make Cs and Ds. Then AFTER school, he writes a couple stupid fucking songs and the paychecks just come rolling in. Meanwhile I can barely afford to pay myself a living wage. / Marten: Sibling rivalry, huh? / Dora: I dunno. It just sucks being the Megadeth to his Metallica, that's all. / Marten: On the bright side, at least Megadeth didn't make St. Anger.

I keep meaning to, but I kinda like just having the flames for now. / Dora: Have you ever thought about getting a tattoo? You'd look cute with some ink on you. / Marten: I dunno, I like the idea but I can't think of anything I'd really like to get. / Dora: You should get a sleeve of pinup girls fighting dinosaurs. Or a wizard fighting a robot! Or a B-52 dropping kittens instead of bombs! / Marten: I thought tattoos were suppose to have a deeper meaning than a bunch of weird drawings. / Dora: Oh there is tons of deep meaning there. The pinup girls represent your feminine side, the dinasours represent the repressive male-dominant society you were raised in. The wizard and the robot represent the struggle between superstition and technology.  / Marten: And the bomber dropping kittens? / Dora: I

Thank god I had an honest excuse. / Hannelore: So you really aren't interested in him, huh. / Faye: As a friend, maybe.

Wil, Penelope. / Sven: Don't mind him, he just gets uncontrollably poetic around girls. / Penelope: I don't mind being oded as long as he keeps it above the neckline.

Faye: I still don't actually remember what happened. / Doctor: That's common in cases of minor concussion.  You've got some nasty bruising on your shoulder, too, but I didn't see any damage in the x-rays. / Dora: I was so scared when you fell off the ladder.  I thought you'd broken your neck. / Doctor: You're very lucky.  A fall from that height could easily have broken some bones, or worse. / Doctor: Anyway, ice that shoulder, take some ibuprofen for the pain, and get plenty of rest.  Contact us immediately if you notice any worsening symptoms.  Do you have someone who can keep an eye on you for the next 24 hours or so? / Faye: Y...yes. / Doctor: Okay then, let me go get the release form and you'll be good to go. / Faye: Did a raccoon REALLY fall out of the vent? / Dora: Yeah, then it ran out the front door. / Faye: Man, I really don't remember. / Dora: You were screaming about "raccoon pogrom" and how you'd "cleanse the earth of their vile little grabby paws."

I need to take my art to the next level, but I can't find the proper muse. / I will find a cold, grey beach and stand on it, staring out to sea.

[[At the cafe]] / You know, people hardly ever order our daily specials. / Good. That means I don't have to make 'em. / I'm just saying, maybe we should try to make them more appealing. / Feh.

"Latte with Dirty Look." "Shot in the dark with Dirty Look." "Tea with Contemptuous Smirk." / You already DO that. How are those "specials?" / I wouldn't charge extra for the dirty looks like I usually do. / So THAT'S why the register is always twenty bucks over at the end of the day.

Are we not doing okay? / No, we're doing all right, I just... The rising expenses gave me a jolt. I worry about the future, that's all. / What do you mean? / I mean, things are okay. I can afford to pay everyone, and pay the bills, and have a little left over for myself at the end of every month. But I've only been running this place for a couple of years, we're not exactly a local institution. What if it turns out not to be sustainable in the long term? / I really like running my own business. I don't think I could handle going back to working for someone else again. So the thought of maybe having to do that someday scares me. / That settles it, then. If Coffee of Doom ever tanks, we'll become bank robbers. Sexy bank robbers! / If we're gonna throw ethics out the window, we should just start a private security firm full of hot chicks.
