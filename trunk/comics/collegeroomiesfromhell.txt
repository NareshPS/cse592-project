I'm leaving tonight and I have to deliver a Christmas gift first. / Dave: What kind of gift? / Roger: You know, the usual Christmassy stuff. Let's see... a framed pic of my dad and sister, a chew toy and fast food. / Dave: I see. I'd go with you, but I'm afraid your mother doesn't like me since I zapped her because she was trying to eat Margaret. / Roger: Aw, she DOES like you. She'd probably like you better with chili sause and a side order of french fries, though. / {{Part of the "Holidays" storyline}}

I'm not a very social person. / Dave: You could *try*. / Margaret: Why do you have to make a big soap opera out of this? You're only leaving for a few days. Stop being so sentimental! / Dave: It wouldn't kill YOU to get sentimental once in a while, Margaret. / Margaret: Wrong. If I got sentimental at this time of year, I'd probably end up killing myself. / Dave: Geez. I'm sorry. Forget I said anything... / Margaret: I'm sorry too. It's not your fault, either.

April: All right, where the HELL have you been??? / Margaret: I slept at the guys'. Why? / April: I was about to call the police? / Margaret: And why'd you do that? / April: Why? Because I was worried about you! / Margaret: You're the most inconsiderate person I've ever known. And besides, you forgot to feed Chester. I'm taking care of him from now on. / April: Oh, and I suppose you're Mother Teresa now, huh? Fine! I'm not staying here anyway! / April: You're supposed to be grateful for other people caring about you, Margaret. / Margaret: Bah. Then they'd expect me to do the same. No, thanks. / April: You're right! It might disturb the piece of bologna you have for a heart! / {{part of "Holidays too"}}

[[Dave Jones has just woken up, and he approaches a door in his parents' house, rubbing his eyes.

Since your brother is living with him... / Blue: I don't mind, Mrs. Jones. I'm glad to help in any way I can. / [[All traces of sleep gone, Dave leans in closer.]] / Mrs. Jones: It sounds crazy, but he looked at me like he was going to kill me. / Blue: That's probably my brother's fault. He loves to play pranks on sleeping people. Dave probably forgot he was home. / Mrs. Jones: But... but the glow... / Blue: That must have been a trick of the light. Like it happens in pictures, when our eyes reflect the light, and it looks like they're glowing. / [[Dave leans back against the wall, a stunned look upon his face]] / Mrs. Jones: I don't know. I'm so worried. I thought so many things last night... drugs, gangs, alchohol... I don't know. Or even worse, maybe he's changing. I don't want him to change, he's always been so sweet and caring... / Blue: I don't think Dave has an addiction problem... Mike would have noticed something like that. I think he doesn't have the time for it either... / [[Dave pulls on a blue jacket and storms away]] / Blue: I bet he's just tense... I heard finals were terrible.

I LOVE this thing! No one is taking it away from me! NO ONE! / Thadeus: I'm sorry, sir, but I'll have to inform her. She has hidden microphones in random places, and I can't take that chance. / Mike: Ooooh, all right. Go tell her. I'm gonna tell her some things myself, as well. / Thadeus: I have nothing to hide, sir. / Mike: Yeah, it's time she knows that you've been in love with her all these years! / Thadeus: I am not, sir. / Mike: Aaw.

But my father didn't like him at all. So what he did was hire a squad of football players to beat him up. / Mike's mom: After he got out of the body cast, I ran away with him. / Thadeus: So if you punish him, Miss Blue would take his side. / Mike's mom: And probably do something foolish.

Margaret doesn't deserve Dave. I was only telling him the truth. / Imaginary floating wiser April: He doesn't need the truth from YOU, and even less when they're so far away from each other.

And you want me to sit and watch? / Dave's Dad: I know it's the hardest thing to do... but we have to let him make his own mistakes. We can't protect him from the world forever...

Blue: All right, Mom. I'll tell you the truth. He didn't fry my eye, but I... um, have a blind spot. It's shrinking every day, and it almost doesn't bother me now, but it's a bit sensitive to light, and so I covered it. / Hazel: Wow. Impressive! You came up with the perfect explanation so I *can't* shoot him. / Blue: It's the truth. Now, if shooting him will really make you happy, go ahead. But it's still unfair. / Hazel: It is fair. He hurts my baby, he gets to suffer. / Blue: Yeah, but why are you the one who always gets all the fun? You're taking away my revenge from me, Ma. / Hazel: What revenge? You have done nothing since he zapped you. / Blue: And yet he tried to jump out of the window yesterday! Don't you see the BEAUTY of it? / Hazel: OH!

Or am I supposed to guess which parts you want me to skip? / Dave: [[downcast]] Mmh.  Okay.  But now Margaret's going to think I'm into weird stuff... / Blue: [[rolling eyes but smiling]] Dave... she thinks you slept with your calculus teacher.  She doesn't seem to mind, does she? / Dave: No.  And sometimes I wish she would. / Blue: Anyway, I have to go or I'll miss the bus. / Dave: Couldn't you have made up a less embarassing lie? / Blue: No, I had to top the sex thing.

I'm not gonna beat you up, or push you down some stairs, or strangle you. / Mike: Nope. / Mike: It ain't gonna happen. / Mike: Even if that jugular vein of yours is visibly throbbing... and CALLING...

I'd say we are just looking at reality from another level of consciousness... / Dave: All very deep and pretty, man, but I just can't take you seriously while you're in that ridiculous pinky costume. / Roger: I was wearing something more serious just a sec ago.

You have a point, and so do I.  We'll decide this with a POUTING contest. / April: Roger, I'm serious!  Will you grow up??? / Roger: Twenty points for you.  And do you think I can get any bigger???

Close the door, Thadeus. / Thadeus: Are you totally, positively sure?  I thought I heard you calling. / Hazel: [[off-panel]] Well, since you are here, fetch me another rubber ducky.  This one broke. / Thadeus: We're all out of rubber duckies. / Hazel: [[off-panel]] My supersoaker, then.

[[The Green Mother is no longer in her bath.  Dressed once again, she strides onward...]] / Hazel: It's very simple.  If she thinks I kidnapped her little friend, she'll stop worrying about it.  I don't want her finding out who was really responsible for it. / Thadeus: Young Master Michael? / Hazel: Exactly.  If he found out about the incident with Blue... well, Michael tends to get a little carried away when it comes to protecting his sister. / Hazel: In any case, I have to make sure he's not getting himself into a mess because of his not-so-subtle revenge. / [[Hazel checks her computer]] / Hazel: And to know where he is keeping this Jones kid, we only need to know where Michael has been. / Hazel: Since the cell phone I gave Michael for Christmas had a hidden tracking device, the only thing we need to do is check the data from the global positioning satellite, and... / Hazel: Oh!  Now... THIS is interesting... / Thadeus: Madam, the clock in the hall exploded again...

Because, um... / Marsha: Because I'm a menace to society and a public danger? / Mike: In a nutshell, that's what they said. / Marsha: Don't say "nutshell". / Mike: Sorry. / Marsha: I'm kidding.  I'm glad to see you.  And I'm sorry I tried to kill you, too. / Mike: Really? / Marsha: Yeah.  Everything is so clear now. / Mike: Everything? / Marsha: Yeah, you know.  Reality.  That little thing you ignore when you're crazy. / Mike: Marsh, you're not crazy.  Why are you saying that? / Marsha: Oh, I know you're just being sweet to me, Mike.  But like they say, the first thing you need to do is to admit you have a problem.

And I bet she hates me because I'm not nice enough! / Marsha: Heheheh.  Yeah right.  You don't have to lie about it anymore. / Marsha: But maybe you're right.  Maybe I imagined it all.  You know.  About the way she looks at you when you're not looking, and all that... / Mike: Listen, Marsh.  I don't know what kind of medication they're giving to you, but... / Marsha: Calm down, Mike.  It's GOOD medication.  I can tell fantasy from reality now.  Take your tentacle, for example.  I know it's a real hand, I just see it differently, because the chemicals in my brain... / Mike: Goldfishpoop!  It IS a tentacle!  Here, touch it! / Marsha: What's the difference?

Dave: [[clutching at his midriff]] Uuugh, Mike.  I think you broke my ribs. / Mike: GOOD!  I'm glad!  And next time you pull a stunt like that, I'm gonna beat you up so badly you'll wish you were ALIVE! / Dave: Why?  What's it to you? / Mike: If it was up to ME, I'd stuff a watermelon down your throat. / Mike: Blue wouldn't like it, tho.  So you better pull your stupid act together. / Dave: Hhhn.  Mike, I don't want to die, but I'm cornered.  If you really want to help me, call off the slave thing.  I tried, but it's becoming impossible for me... / Mike: Harumph.  And what am I supposed to do? / Dave: They'll take your cast off soon.  In the meantime, I promise I'll help you whenever I can... / Mike: All right.  But you owe me one. / Dave: Thanks. / Roger: Dave and Mike are finally out of the closet and exploring their wild side. Want to be my new roomie? / April: Are you out of your freaking mind? / Roger: I'll take that as a YES.

Roger: April, Dave just whined himself out of his slave deal with Mike, so guess who'll have to do all of his chores!  I just HAVE to move! / April: Nope. / Roger: It'll only be temporary!  Two or three weeks, while Mike gets out of his cast.  C'mon. / April: Nope. / Roger: I'm afraid you have no choice.  If you don't agree to be my roomie, I'll have to move in with Diana and Paul, and there's no room for us all. / April: You WOULDN'T. / Roger: I'm sorry, tough life.  So you in or out? / April: Damn it!  All right.  Sheesh... / Roger: [[doing a victory dance]] Woooo!  Female roomie!

[[A horned Will, eyes leaping from their sockets, lusts after a haloed, divinely lit Jackie; a large, green Will hulks menacingly in the background]] / April: No.  That's not how it happened. / Will: Which of us is TELLING this story? / April: You're a good guy, Will.  The kind people can COUNT on.  The kind that's hard to find. / April: You might have HAD dark feelings about her, but you didn't ACT on them.  That's what counts. / [[Mike, crutch in background, sweeps April from her feet with a lingering kiss; Mike laughs at April, who examines her green hair as Marsha clubs her from behind; a tearstained April, spattered with brown goop, wanders off, her heart shattered]] / Will: ...Mike?  MIKE? / April: [[tears rolling down her cheeks, hugging a cushion]] But... I guess I deserved a lot of it. / Will: Like FLARK you did! / Will: ...MIKE??? / Mike: [[off-panel]] Me what? / [[Mike enters and spots an enormous blond chap on Roger's sofa]] / Mike: Whoa, Roger, you really need to stop drink so much milk...

[[Meanwhile, Rikk talks to Dave...]] / Dave: Oh, my God... / Rikk: I saw six-six-six on her forehead as clearly as I see the circles under your EYES. / Rikk: I tried to warn her about it, but... / [[Flashback]] / Meighan: [[rolling her eyes]] Sure, Rikk.  Like you're the first Christian who's told me I'm going to Hell. / Meighan: ... Look... I appreciate what you went through to rescue us.  But ever since your breakdown, you've been seeing threats EVERYWHERE.  Sorry.  But I don't feel any more accursed than normal. / Rikk: I have Tim watching her right now.  That's the best I can do. / Rikk: Agent Mist has been with the F.I.B. for years, and if he IS Satan... / Dave: Wait wait BACK UP. / [[Agent Mist, looking smug]] / Rikk: [[narrating]] They say the Devil has the power to assume a pleasing shape... and Alisin's told me Mist IS handsome, in a Trent Reznor kind of way. / Rikk: [[narrating]] Then she got flustered and apologetic, but that's kind of off-topic. / Rikk: I'm sorry you guys are... distant, by the way.  But at least now you know what living with her is like.  It's good to try these things out. / Dave: Can we get back to Satan?  It's less depressing...

Dave: Mist has been with the F.I.B. for years?  This... this powerful government organization nobody knew about until LATELY? / Rikk: [[off-panel]] Yeah. / Dave: So why hasn't he taken over the world already?  He wouldn't even BOTHER with Meighan... unless you guys had something he wanted. / Rikk: ..."Knowledge"...  He said he wanted "KNOWLEDGE..."  You... don't believe he IS Satan? / Dave: If he's NOT, then I'm not the guy you want to ask for advice.  If he IS... / Dave: Don't believe anything he says.  If he says right, go up.  If he says up, stand STILL.  He'll try to make you believe that the game is already over. / Dave: But it's not.  You don't have to play HIS game. / Dave: Also... I don't believe for a minute that Margaret and I survived alone out there. / Dave: We had help. / Dave: Capital "H" Help. / [[Back in April's room, Will still has Mike pinned to the floor]] / Will: April? / Will: Tell me he's lying. / April: ... / April: He's not. / April: I've tried to get him killed before.

I know nice girls go for bad guys, but GHOD... / April: What part of "tried to get him killed" was unclear, Will? / April: I'm NOT a nice girl anymore. / Mike: It certainly erases you off MY "nice" list... / [[Will winds up a haymaker on Mike, who desperately tries to shield himself with his tentacle]] / Will: LOOK what you DID to her! / Will: You may not have taken her VIRGINITY, you slime, but you took her INNOCENCE. / Will: I ought to-- to-- / Mike: [[standing up gingerly, clutching at his ribs]] / Mike: I don't understand.  I don't understand anything. / Will: [[partially off-panel -- all we see of him are two enormous fists]] What's to understand?  You RUIN everything you touch! / Mike: You LOVE me, April?  I thought you hated my guts.  This is insane.  You guys are insane. / Will: Sure, play innocent now! / Mike: But if you love me, why are you trying to kill me? / April: Mike... / Mike: Oh wait, I don't want to know.  I don't want to have ANYTHING to do with this.  This never happened, and I'll forget what you said.  / April: It's not gonna solve... / Mike: I don't CARE.  It works for me.  I never came here.  I was mugged.  That is what I'm gonna say, and I'll never admit to anything else.  Just... stay away from me. / [[Mike tries to leave, but Will blocks the exit]] / Will: Where do you think YOU'RE going? / Mike: Let's just say I took the proper beating for kissing your girlfriend, and that we're even. / Mike: But don't be surprised if you're walking down the street one day and... / Mike: [[holding his tentacle in Will's face, and clenching it threateningly]] CRACK. / Mike: [[leaving, off-panel]] Actually, on second thought, be surprised.  I plan to sneak up on you from behind.  Just because I'm a bastard. / [[Will's teeth are gritted and his fists are clenched -- he tries to follow Mike]] / April: [[holding him back]] Will.  Don't.

Worrying, being depressed and estranged, having dreams... / Dave: Yeah, dreams... did you know she sleeps naked?  Three feet from me.  They suffocate me.  Everywhere. / Rikk: ... ih? / Dave: Sorry, g'wan. / Rikk: It's pretty obvious you're exhausted.  And you still gave me some insight that might have saved my friends' lives.

You know EVERYTHING better than me. / Dave: Eh?  I don't get it. / Mike: C'mon, Dave.  I got my ass kicked for something I didn't do.  I'm sure you can relate. / Dave: Me?

I thought he had an accident, or fell down some stairs... / Dave: Well, I don't know.  Would you be uh, impressed if someone had? / Margaret: Maybe.  Mike seems really hard to beat, because he's tricky, and because of the tentacle.  But if it was someone he knew, he could have been caught with his guard down. / Dave: Oh.  So?  I bet he deserved it anyway!  It's Mike! / Margaret: That's hardly the point. / Margaret: ANYWAY.  Unless he asks me for help to retaliate, I guess it's not my problem. / Dave: Nnnot mmine either. / Margaret: [[eyeing Dave suspiciously, thinking]] Could it be that...?

Face it, Mike... your relationship is as strong as a house of CARDS. / Mike: You can talk until your tongue falls off, and it still won't make a difference. / April: If you're so SURE about your love, why don't you just do it?  Why do you have to lie? / Mike: I am SO SURE, I believe that I don't have to prove a damn thing to you. / April: I see!  You're afraid.

Do you know how to turn this thing around and get us home? / Mike: Pssch.  How hard can it be? / Dave: We know NOTHING about ships!  And we don't even know where we ARE! / Roger: Hum!  Laser Face's got a point, you know... / Mike: WHAT???  I can't believe you guys are such WUSSIES. / Dave: Call me a wussy but this time I want to play safe.  I don't want to be lost in the middle of the sea. / Mike: Aw, come ON! / Roger: And I agree.  Two votes to one.  Tough luck. / Mike: See?  SEE?  THIS is why democracy doesn't work.  Too much talking leads to not enough violence!

It ensures there won't be any inappropriate behaviour... / April: [[thinking]] Not even a little bit of inappropriateness?  AAAAW. / Marsha's Masseur: Gosh... are you okay?

[[Mike is leaning over the edge of the liferaft, staring into the water and smiling vaguely]] / Mike: What?  What did you say? / Mike: That's funny! / Mike: *snicker* / Dave: Is Mike brain-dead or what? / Roger: Dunno.  Don't want to find out. / Dave: Do you think the lack of oxygen did actually damage his brain? / Mike: [[still talking to the water]] No, they are just my roomies.  It's such a long, long story... / Roger: I hope not.  We will need all the brains we have to get out of this one. / Dave: C'mon.  Mike is smart, but what makes you think he'll find a way? / Roger: I'm not saying he's smarter than you or me, but when his butt is on the line, the man is almost a damn genius. / Dave: If he's so smart, why are we here in the first place?  I say... / Mike: [[holding a fish in his tentacle]] Well, I'd love you to be my guest, but it's just not gonna happen. / Mike: No, it's like I'm telling you, man... you can't live out of the water!  See?  You start dying and stuff...

Dave: Wait!  Don't throw it back! / Mike: Why not? / Dave: Are you CRAZY?  We can eat it! / Mike: We can't eat him... he's my friend! / Roger: Disregard my friend and his careless use of the "C" word.  Still, you can't throw it back! / Mike: And what's YOUR reason? / Roger: Well, it would be pretty damn irresponsible.  The ocean is pretty polluted and full of predators. / Mike: But if I don't, he's gonna die anyway. / Roger: Yeah, but at least his death would be noble and serve a purpose.  Right? / Mike: Oh.  Well, maybe you're right.  I don't think he's gonna like it, tho'. / Roger: He's in a better place, Mike.  A place without oil spillages. / Dave: [[licking his lips]] Mmmh.  Gimme gimme!  Don't worry, I'll give him a Viking funeral...

[[Roger retrieves a piece of flotsam]] / Roger: YESSS!!  Plastic bag! / Dave: What's so good about it? / Roger: We can use it to turn sea water into fresh water! / Dave: Get OUT.  Really? / Roger: Yeah.  Do you think you can bring water to a boiling point? / Dave: I think so.  I can try. / Roger: Excellent.  Now we need to find two different-sized containers.  We put one inside the other... / Mike: [[retrieving more flotsam]] COOOL!!!  An old buoy! / Mike: This is the happiest day of my whole life!!! / [[Roger has handed the buoy to Dave, who uses his laser vision to cut the buoy into halves]] / Dave: You said to cut BELOW the red line, right? / Roger: Uh-huh.  C'mon, Mike... It's, it's just a magic trick.  We'll put it back together later, I promise. / Mike: [[his face buried in the tube of the liferaft]] I'm not talking to you, you MURDERERS.

My head is starting to throb. / Roger: Hey, that's okay.  We have enough water for today. / Dave: Don't rhyme so much, it's annoying. / Mike: [[his head over the side]] A defiance, you say?  Nah, it was never my intention. / Roger: Tell that to Shakespeare. / Mike: But I wasn't talking to him. / [[Mike is talking to an octopus.  They touch tentacles.  Mike pigments his interestingly]] / Mike: So it was because of the colors?  I didn't notice.  And I'm not the Annihilator... that was just an accident. / Mike: I'm sorry, I can't be your new King. / Mike: I just want to go home. / Dave: Blah.  I should have stopped sooner.

And they're moving it! / Roger: I think the word is "octopi". / Mike: Don't kill them!  Please! / Roger: Let me guess.  They're your friends? / Mike: YES!  They're just trying to help! / Dave: Yeah, right! / Roger: Wait a minute, Dave.  I don't think it's a good idea to blast them. / Dave: What?  I don't want to be eaten by a bunch of octowhatever! / Roger: We don't know what they want, but do you really want to push Mike over the edge?  I don't think this raft can take a rasslin' session. / Dave: Mmh.  Point. / [[Mike hugs Roger, incidentally choking him with his tentacle]] / Mike: You're so NICE!  Thank youuuuu... / Dave: Oh, so now Mike's the nut, Roger's the good one, and I'm the bad guy??? / Roger: If you were any good you'd just KILL me...

But I can't remember HER. / Dave: I had a mild fever, and everything felt like a dream.  It was MY dream.  And it died so suddenly, I couldn't even mourn it.  Until a while ago. / Roger: Uh-huh. / Dave: And I know that everything's over, but knowing is not the same as BELIEVING.  It's still hard for me to accept it. / Roger: Sheesh, I don't believe this.  How can you be so blind? / Dave: Uh?  Why?  What are you talking about? / Roger: Isn't it obvious?  Dave, she LOVES you.

[[Dave and Roger are strewn with kelp]] / Dave: Well, the sun is going down.  I guess I don't need this anymore.  I have enough reasons to be pissed off besides of looking like a fool. / Roger: You know what your problem is?  You think you're the center of the freaking universe. / Dave: You mean I'm NOT???  I should have noticed the lack of gravity... / Roger: Why are you acting like you're some kind of victim?  What about Margaret?  Do you think it's not hard for her too? / Dave: Oh, I get it.  You're taking her side because you're doing exactly the same thing to Diana!  You're pretending to be noble, when in fact you guys just don't have the GUTS to fight for the person you love.  Isn't that it? / Roger: Did you just... call me a coward, Dave? / Dave: I believe that I did in fact call you a cowardly spineless CHICKEN. / Roger: Just checking.

Marsha: You didn't answer the question. When did it start? Last year, when Mike and I started dating? / April: [[off-panel]] You don't know a THING, do you? / Marsha: Maybe it's a trick question.  Answer it anyway. / April: [[off-panel]] Fine.  My first conscious effort was telling you about the kiss. / Marsha: [[off-panel]] AHA. So your plan was breaking us up, then moving in for the kill. / April: Wrong AGAIN.  I did that, mostly, for a revenge. / Marsha: [[off-panel]] Revenge??  What did I do to you? / April: You, nothing.  I thought Mike was toying with my feelings.  As I found out later, he didn't have a clue. / Marsha:Then I suppose all your recent efforts to keep us apart have nothing to do with revenge.  Were you planning to make your move on him? / April: My move?  Heh.  You're dense.  He HATES me.  He wouldn't date me in a million years.  / Marhsa: Then, WHY? / April: Because I decided, some time ago... that if his smile couldn't be mine, then he would never smile AGAIN.

No matter what my intentions were, I have done nothing beyond twisting the truth a little here and there. / April: What is YOUR excuse? / Marsha: My excuse for what? / April: [[off-panel]] The pain I have caused Mike is NOTHING compared to what YOU have done to him.

That's the standard procedure with new prisoners.  He's not new, you idiot, he escaped.  I don't have any files on him, ergo, he's new, ergo, he gets the serum.  Ergo you blew it!  You don't understand.  His sequence is different from anything I have ever seen.  This is not a computer bug, I am SURE he doesn't belong here.   Look, if anybody asks, he wouldn't talk, do you hear?  Put him to sleep and in a while we'll come to take him to the D section.  He's already asleep.  I don't care, that's the standard procedure.

But with a swift kick to the nuts... / Mike: Oh!  So does that mean I gotta kick you in the nuts to make you remember another way? / Dr. Sydney: Really... ggh, only a big shock... also, kkhhg, eventually... / Mike: Nonono, I need my memories NOW, not eventually.

Damascus: Exactly.  There's no such thing as a crisis.  Only problems.  And YOU deal with problems.

Who do you think you are, Superman?  You're just fragile flesh and bone, like her parents and any close friend she's ever had. / [[Flashback continues: now Margaret confronts the Satan-serpent as she comforts Dave]] / Margaret: What the hell do you want, snake?

And why did you two get into that catfight, anyway? / Diana: Because Roger is hiding something from me, and I thought it was that April was after him too. / Marsha: So why is he hiding something?  Is he afraid you'd get mad? / Diana: Well, he told me he was afraid it was too weird, even by his standards. / Marsha: Pfft.  Right.

But silly, my kids are going to freak out!  They don't know I know they call me a Dragon behind my back! / Damascus: Heh.  We'll say it was something you requested. / Hazel: I still don't understand why you have all these creatures, but your angels are robots. / Damascus: Ah, that.  Yes, we have two problems with the angels.  First, they can't float. / Damascus: Flapping around while giving a speech is very impractical. / Damascus: Second, the same problem we have with the other human-based creatures. / Damascus: Basically, we have to keep them drugged to control them.  The moment they have a mind they start looking for trouble.  I am trying other methods of thought control, like religion... but for now, AI does a better job. / Hazel: Right.  Well, there are a lot of other things you can try.

Then, we are... cool. / Diana: What I'd like to know is WHY he wouldn't tell me. / Marsha: Wuwell, see.  It was just because... he didn't want you to think... he was a REALLY BIG PERV.  Uh.

But I think he sometimes can't help it. / Diana: And... he eats people, and stuff? / Marsha: Naah.  Although I think he's afraid he could. / Diana: So that's why he didn't tell me?  Because he's afraid of himself? / Marsha: Who understands men?  I'm still puzzled as to why Mike said something horrible to me.  He obviously wanted me to dump him, but darned if I know why. / April: [[off-panel, still in fever dreams]] Hahah... you idiot... because you poisoned his little sister, why else? ... hahaha... pffft...

Marsha?  I'm going home. / Marsha: Wha?  WHY? / Diana: Yeah, I have a lot of thinking to do.  You too. / Marsha: Are you gonna leave me alone with HER??? / Diana: April isn't in danger.  Her fever is under control.  You're only standing beside her because you think she's still your friend. / Marsha: What is that supposed to mean? / Diana: [[leaving]] That you still have a problem facing reality, that's all. / Diana: April hates you, and you're a terrible cook.  Those are the facts.  What are you going to do about it? / Diana: [[off-panel]] You can keep on lying to yourself, or you can make a decision, and STICK to it.

I wish there was a way to be sure... / Roger: Okay, Mike, we need to focus on getting Dave and then splitting.  We don't have time to worry about anything else. / Mike: Well, you're right.  Anyway, I did my best.  Now c'mon, we can count on the blackout helping us a little bit, so we better use it while we can. / Mike: Right? / [[Roger is staring transfixed at a large red glowing button on the wall]] / Mike: [[off-panel]] Roger?

I'm a mutant now? / April: I don't know.  But they are real.  And you seem to have some... dead skin hanging from your back. / Marsha: EEW!  Hey, wait a minute... / Marsha: Do you think it was because of the SPA?  Because of the hot stones, and the massages with exotic oils, and all that stuff? / April: No, I think the wings were already under your skin.  And then you got ONE TOO MANY exfoliation treatment. / Marsha: I wish my parents just gave me a spice grinder like I requested. / April: Plus, your hair smells like potatoes.

{{Author's note: Small note about this storyline: As you probably noticed, the Dun-dun Island saga has finished. We still have to deal with the aftermath of it, but for this week, though, we're having a small intermission of events out of the normal continuity. This storyline, Elastic, is canon, but it's situated in the past, between "Holidays Too" and "It had to be You". I know a lot of you are missing the "school" part of CRFH, and so we're having "Elastic" as a breather, which is also drawn in a different art style. Don't worry, tho, it will only last seven days, and then we'll be back to our regular story. In the meantime, have fun.}} / Dover: [[off-panel]] As you see, finding the area of a region between two curves is SO boring and trivial.

[[Blue and Dave explore the dungeons]] / Dave: When you said dungeons, I was expecting... dunno, something more... / Blue: Medieval? / Dave: I thought your mother had a taste for drama... / Blue: They don't look like cells so she can disguise them as storage rooms... / [[They peer through a slot in a cell door]] / Dave: It's just an empty room.  At least there are no shackles or spiky stuff. / Blue: No, but you see those metal streaks on the floor? / Dave: Huh? / Blue: They can be programmed to deliver an electric shock at totally random times. / Dave: Well, you can avoid that if you stand up. / Blue: Exactly.  Diabolical, don't you think. / Dave: You're not serious. / Blue: Does it look like I'm not? / Dave: My God, you are.  And she would do something like that to Mike? / Blue: No, something WORSE.

Dave: Why is the security so tight around this place? / Blue: Because this is the infamous Maximum Fun Chamber. / Dave: Here?  This is just another empty room, like the others... / Blue: [[pointing]] No.  Actually, THERE. / [[A faintly greenish glow surrounds a glass sarcophagus-like device]] / Dave: THIS???  I have heard so much about it, and this is IT? / Blue: Well, if it was bigger, you could actually move in there, which would be better... / Dave: Why don't you open it so we can take a look inside? / Blue: I can't open it. / Dave: So how do we know if Mike's inside?  Can you hear him in there? / Blue: [[ear pressed to the Chamber]] No, it's sound-proof.  But if there's someone inside, you can hear the machinery work- / [[Total darkness envelops the room]] / Dave: ACK! / Blue: Ugh.  Well, it's raining outside.  Probably a normal power outage. / Dave: Am I supposed to be alarmed? / Blue: No, no.  I mean, I'm sure there's plenty of air in this room.  Enough, I hope, for both of us, at least until the electronic locks are operational again. / Dave: Good!  Then I can start hyperventilating right now...

[[Blue and Dave are in the room containing the Maximum Fun Chamber.  The lights are back on.  Dave is holding Blue as a shield.]] / Blue: Heh.  You get pretty nervous in the darkness, don't you, Dave? / Dave: Pfft!  You don't get it.  Even in an empty room, disaster awaits for me.  I walk around and civilization collapses.  Empires crumble.  Milk curdles. / Blue: Dave... / Dave: Small dogs explode... / Blue: Who says I'm complaining?  Now let's get out of here. / [[Blue types in an exit code.]] / Blue: Oh crap. / Dave: What is it now? / Blue: It... seems like the power outtage reset the system.  My code doesn't work... / Dave:  See?  SEE?  Now, let's just sit and wait for the piano to fall on me!

Where are Dave and Blue? / Thadeus: I have not seen them.  They were not there when Jay was put in your room by Madame, and I wasn't sure if you wanted her to know you came home, sir. / Mike: *SIGH* The fun never stops, huh?  Anyway, I don't need them.  But Dave's been bugged and I need the password for Mom's laptop. / Thadeus: If I might inquire, what for? / Mike: Deleting Dave's data.  Dundun damages, duh? / Thadeus: Beautiful alliteration, sir.  What else do you need?  My corneas?  My liver?  You sound like you could use a spare brain.

Mike: What? Thad, you're in this. If I don't delete Dave's location data, Mom's gonna know EVERYTHING. You just HAVE to cooperate. / Thad: I am sorry, sir. But everything I have done so far could be explained or at least forgiven.  / Mike: But THAD...! / Thad: If I give you Madam's password and we get caught, I am going to get killed and then fired, in whichever order. No go. / Mike: RIGHT. So, since I'm getting tossed in the Maximum Fun Chamber anyway, I think I'll just go and roll myself dry on the Aubusson Carpet. / Thad: NOT the AUBUSSON carpet!!!

It's just... everything's going awful.  I mean, look at you, and Mike, he's acting all strange... and Dad... / Dave: Uh.  Mmmh. / Blue: I'm frightened.  I don't know what the Hell is going on anymore. / Dave: Well, I don't understand a lot of things either.  And other things... I'm not sure I'm actually the right person to tell you... / Blue: What have you guys been doing???  How could you get shot?  Are you in even MORE trouble than I know? / Dave: Mike should explain it all to you.  There is some heavy stuff there, but we didn't look for trouble, it was merely our bad luck. / Blue: Luck?  C'mon.  Luck and Santa Claus, it's all the same. / Dave: You're right, every day of my life feels like getting crushed by a big fat guy in a red suit.

So he asked me to say something else. / Mike's Mom: And what is that? / Mike: He made up a totally ridiculous story about how he discovered I'm gay and THAT caused him the heart attack. / Mike's Mom: Okay, *I* don't buy it.  You would never agree to something like that. / Mike: Yeah, the story was that I was so angry at him for believing I'm gay, I "admitted" it just to spite him.  See?

Why don't you just tell her the truth?  Nothing that has already happened is your fault! / Mike: You just don't get it, Dave.  I know what I'm doing. / Dave: I didn't even KNOW you guys had this much money until I came here.  I have never even thought about it... / Mike: Okay.  See?  THAT is your problem.  My mother was looking for your buttons.  And now that she found them, she will push them EVERYTIME. / Dave: I'm a decent guy.  So what if my socks have a hole or two?

How can this be worse than my Mom? / Dave: I... I don't know if I can take that anymore.  I thought it was behind me.  I thought things would be different... / Mike: Money is not that important, Dave.  You're exaggerating. / Dave: Sure, YOU ca say that.  Money is not a big deal when you have LOTS of it, Mike. / Mike: Maybe you're right.  But believe me, for Blue and for me, money is just a LEASH.  She just doesn't care. / Dave: I dunno.

You know Michael... he's so sentimental! / Thadeus: And is it not, Madame? / Mike's Mom: Just a while ago I inflicted a crushing humiliation on the Jones kid, and Michael didn't stop me.  He only did it when he thought Blue was on the line. / Mike's Mom: It seems obvious now that Michael's just pretending to be a close friend of David, only to keep a very close eye on him! / Mike's Mom: He even brought him here with H'astur knows what excuse, knowing too well that the poor schmuck would be horribly intimidated by our wealth. / Mike's Mom: In short, Thadeus, he's doing my job!

YOU can stay away / Dave: So that's your solution?  I suppose it's easy for you to say it.  I would only have to give up on Blue! / Mike: No.  I'm not saying that.

Why should I let that furry psycho carry Margaret? / Mike: Because I'm a tyrannical jerk who always demands unconditional obedience. / Mike: And since *I* have the car keys, and I'm gonna walk really fast and drive away while you stumble with her through the whole forest. / Dave: [[to Roger]] Right.  okay, I *think* I can control myself.

I just wanted Satan to leave you guys alone. / Dave: He's not gonna leave us alone, Margaret.  Look at all the stuff that happened to me while you were away. / Margaret: Yeah, but that's just because he knows you love me.  He knows you just can't let me go. / Dave: Well.  Back at the raft... I was pretty pissed at you because you lied to me.  but you're not to blame.  After all, I blackmailed you into making promises.  But I hated you at the time.  And bad stuff just... kept happening. / Dave: And right now... I can't say I don't care about you.  That would be a lie.  But I... / Dave: Margaret... I just don't know if I love you anymore.  So if you're gonna make a decision... / Margaret: Dave.  Can I ask you a hypothetical question? / Dave: Uh?

I'm not buying it.  Think of something BETTER. / Roger: Nggh.  Well, I thought if I ever lost control of my human mind, I'd just kill her. / Roger: As it happened, I just licked her wounds, but I was not feeding on her blood.

The animal and inanimate object kind, which we can safely ignore for now.  Secondly, what we can call the pre-possession stage, which leads to a full possession.  Am I missing anything? / Margaret: You're forgetting about satanic influence.  You know, the kind that makes us go evil.  Like April. / April: EXCUSE ME??? I wasn't influenced by Satan.  Who the Hell says I can't be bad?  I will be evil if I want to! / Marsha: But why would you WANT to be evil?  It makes no sense! / April: Why NOT?  Suppose, for a moment, that I don't like you.

I need a favor. / Dave: Does this favor involve any of my internal organs? / April: Perhaps just one. / Dave: All right, but only if it's above the waist.  And your notes better be REALLY good.

[[Dave and April are talking in the park]] / Dave: Before you start talking... if it has something to do with conspiring against Mike, I don't want in.  I don't even want to KNOW about it. / April: Since WHEN are you such a big Mike fan? / Dave: Since he's including me in his plan to make Dover give us a new chance.  I have no idea how to do that on my own. / April: Right.  Well, it IS about Mike.  But I just wanted to know something. / Dave: Well, ask away.  I can't promise I will answer.  Talking too much can get me in trouble too, you know? / April: Dave, how could you do it?  How could you forget about Margaret? / Dave: Uh, April, I know you sort of wanted to see us together, but... / April: No, you don't get it.  I need to know how you did it. / Dave: Uh? How I did what? / April: I need to know how you can stop loving someone.  Because I CAN'T.

[[Dave and April are talking, outdoors]] / April: I have tried everything.  I have tried to ignore him.  He certainly DOES ignore me... / Dave: April, he's a jerk.  Why are you supprised? / April: I'm not.  I have tried hating him, too.  It was easy.  And... it didn't work.  So what did you do? / Dave: I did nothing.  I just realized I deserve better.  Perhaps it feels heroic to be treated like crap and still loving someone... but it doesn't last forever. / Dave: I was in love when I felt happy while I thought about her.  But all that stopped happening.  Eventually, all I could feel was pain. / Dave: If it's the same for you, then it's not love anymore.  Perhaps you're stubborn.  perhaps you feel it's not fair you never had a chance. / April: *sigh* / Dave: Perhaps you're just afraid of being alone. / Dave: Besides, I'm sure you can find someone a zillion times better than Mike.  I dunno, one of those rich and good-looking guys... / April: But Mike IS rich and good-looking. / Dave: Or an optometrist. / April: Dave, I'm serious.  And I'm not that good at dating either. / Dave: Look... being alone won't kill you.  It doesn't kill ME.

Anyway, your signal disappeared a few days ago.  And of course, I got rid of mine... / Dave: Really?  Well, that's a relief.  How did YOU get rid of it? / Blue: I tasered myself!  Hardly fun, but I'm not depressed anymore... / Dave: You did WHAT?  You people are crazy.  Um, so, yeah, that explains it... / Blue: But let's not talk about nasty things.

Are you feeling well? / Dave: Yeah. But I think... I think we just need to calm down. / Blue: That's fine with me. Mind if I ask why? / Dave: I mean... it's just that sometimes you act like you're my girlfriend, and sometimes I act like I'm your boyfriend. But we don't actually have a relationship. / Blue: I'm not pressuring you into anything you don't want. / Dave: You don't understand. I actually want it. I just don't feel ready yet, okay? / Blue: So you're asking me for some time off?  It sounds like a familiar speech. / Dave: Low blow, Blue. VERY low. / Blue: I'm sorry.

But you're rich, and you're used to the good stuff, so... / Blue: I... can't believe you just said something like that to me. / Dave: Please don't be mad at me... it's just that I... / Blue: Sorry.

Roger: I have a small suggestion for you. You should smear yourself with honey and look for a bee farm. / Dave: What kind of STUPID advice is that??? / Roger: Maybe then you'd worry about a problem that's already happening, instead of something that is you know, just in your head? / Dave: Roger, it's not in my head!  If I ask her to be my girlfriend in my situation... / Roger: Dave, your situation only goes from bad to worse and then back to bad. Just consider that. / Dave: Yeah, you're right about that. So I guess it sucks to be me, as always. / Roger: It's all relative.  For example, Mike asked me this morning if I can grow independent parts of my body at a given time.  THAT is what I'd call worrying. / Dave: She was the only person who ever listened to me, and I drove her away. / Roger: You're still talking?

I wish you could let someone else do it instead. / Mike: Well, if someone's going to be in charge of stopping Armaggedon, ironically enough, I'd feel safer doing it myself. / [[Marsha snuggles into him]] / Marsha: Is that why you told me you wanted to marry me?  Because you think the world is going to end soon? / Mike: Uuh... partly, I guess.  I don't know.

The whole thing is stupid. / Dave: But Blue... this is real.  This is a real problem for me, you know? / Dave: I *know* it's not your fault.  I am the one who's got to look for a way to solve it.

Mr. Dover: Go on.  I want to hear it.  Just admit it, and we'll talk about it. / Mike: Admit what?  You're starting to freak me out, sir... / Mr. Dover: You think you're the only one?  C'mon.  It's not going to be as bad as you think. / Mike: Look, Mr. Dover.  I just don't KNOW what you're talking about. / [[Mr. Dover jumps on Mike]] / Mr. Dover: Leaving me all the initiative?

Dave: I should be in bed.  With an electric blanket. / Roger: I'd settle for a full bathtub and a random household electric appliance. / Dave: That could work just as well. / Margaret: [[indicating Marsha and April]] That's a perfectly good waste of water and electricity.  When you guys want to die, just get between these two. / April: This is perfectly useless, Marsha.  Knowing Mike, he'll actually be pissed that we're here waiting for him as if he was some sort of prissy princess soft fluffy girl. / Marsha: You know, April, I have the hunch I MIGHT know Mike maybe just a LITTLE better than you, don't you think? / April: Bitch. / Marsha: *Engaged* bitch!

April: So, let me get this straight.  You're sad because TWO women are in love with you?  Wow, you're truly a maelstrom of misery. / Dave: Well, if I was you, and Mike didn't love me, that would be a very good start. / April: You're not a girl. / Dave: I could be any carbon-based life form, and probably any silicon-based life form too, and it STILL would be true. / April: Well, what do you think *I* am? / Dave: A hate-based life form? / Marsha: So, I've got faith Mike will fix this thing for us.  But if he doesn't, I expect you all to be supportive.  AND grateful.  Dig? / Margaret: I dunno.  When I try to be supportive, the receiving end usually needs therapy aftwerwards. / Roger: Why should I be grateful?  I'm sure he will make sure I pay dearly for this. / Marsha: Aw, it's just so he doesn't appear like the big softie he is. / [[Mike joins them]] / Mike: [[completely shell-shocked]] I think I need a hug.

Any of our places could be bugged.  Thanks April! / April: [[off-panel]] Aw, it was just a little white lie... / Dave: Whatever.  Can we get to it?  All this sunlight is bad for my depression. / Roger: [[off-panel]] Not to mention the ant hills.  HAH!  HAH!  OUCH! / Marsha: All I'm saying is that if I get the dooky you won't get the nookie. / Mike: [[off-panel]] Aaaanyway.  It has come to my attention that we all hate each other.  Normally I wouldn't give a damn, but I'm a bit concerned this could be some sort of "Divide and Conquer" strategy... / Roger: Why would Satan need a strategy?  You're all JERKS! / Margaret: Not to mention far too sensitive drama queens. / Dave: [[off-panel]] I suggest that I laser your heads off!  THAT'll solve the problem! / Roger: Nah, too flashy.

That was bad too, for some reason... oh yeah, that Dave hates me. / Dave: [[off-panel]] I don't hate you or Margaret.

There IS a catch. / Mike: [[off-panel]] So, you not coming?  That's bad.  I was gonna tell Diana and Paul to come along too. / Roger: And the catch keeps getting bigger and bigger!  Now I HAVE to join in. / Margaret: If you say it's good for NOES, then I'm in too. / April: Hey, are you gonna be wearing shorts or briefs? / Mike: [[off-panel]] Shorts. / April: TINY shorts? / Mike: [[off-panel]] NO. / April: Me and my scissors are IN! / Margaret: I'm not doing it for potential weapon shopping.  But if the occasion comes, why not? / Dave: Have fun, all of you. / Mike: You gotta be kidding. / Dave: I'm not.  Two days on that raft with you guys were enough to immunize me against ocean jones for at least TEN years. / Mike: You know Dave, it takes a special kind of skill to take a free trip to GirlsGoneWildLand and turn it into a BAD thing. / Dave: No, it just takes a very special kind of LIFE!

I'm not going on your stupid trip! / Mike: Ba-pssch.  Of course you are. / Dave: No, I'm NOT! / Mike: Start packing already.  What was I looking for again? / Dave: Your brain, maybe?  I SAID I'm not going! / Mike: [[poking Dave in the chest]] Look, man.  You owe me BIG time.  I let you use my cell phone (which you destroyed on a whim), saved your ass from Dover, saved your ass from my MOM, and I'm giving you an all-expenses paid trip to Topless Paradise.  The only thing I'm asking in return is that you pretend to be my gay lover! / Dave: Well it's true that I...  Uh, what?  Did you just SAY what I think you said? / Mike: Yes you did!

Get used to the idea. / Roger: Aw.  We could use one, you know.  It doesn't have to be a really big one... / Mike: Roger, I'm trying to think here.  What's your fixation with orgies lately, man? / Roger: Well, it's because of Diana.  She's upset because she thinks we don't like her enough to invite her to our orgies. / Mike: But we haven't HAD any orgies!!! / Roger: Isn't that always the core of all trouble?

Now, let's set the rules. / Margaret: YOU are gonna set the rules??? / Dave: You can set some of your own, too. Anyway, here's mine: first, no violence. / Margaret: What, not even a little bit? / Dave: No. Also, no yelling. No name-calling. No bad-mouthing Blue. / Margaret: WhatEVER! / Dave: No touching. No kissing. No hugging. No nothing. / Margaret: You have some NERVE! / Dave: Also, we either leave as friends, or as merely neighbors and members of NOES. And that's it. / Margaret: Is that so? Fine. I only have one rule. You will talk about your feelings, without expecting me to guess them, or getting angry because I don't. You will talk, even if it hurts. Especially if it hurts. Agreed? / Dave: Uh, can I change some of my rules? / Margaret: Sit. Your ass. DOWN. Dave.

Mike: Hello, brat. Hey, have you seen Marsha around? / Blue: Not really. But I wouldn't worry. You know how she likes to make an entrance. / Mike: Heh! Well, yeah... What's with the long face? Where's your boytoy? / Blue: I dunno, Mike. Off... somewhere. With Margaret. / Mike: Seriously? Mh. Uh, do you want me to kick his ass? Just say the word, I only need to get my chainsaw gauntlet. / Blue: Not really. I think Dave just needs to be able to sort this stuff on his own, without lots of mutilation. / Mike: Blue. I'm sorry, but that's dumb. As if Dave was ever capable of sorting anything. He's just Our Lady of Perpetual Confusion. / Blue: I have to believe he can do it. If he can't... Well, maybe it's up to me to make a decision?

And yeah, i've been telling her to raise her rates.

Dave: Mh, right. So... uh. Who's first? / Margaret: I dunno, YOU? You were the one who dragged me here to talk. So talk. / Dave: I don't know where to start. You... / Margaret: Fine, i'll start. Dave, I can't keep on apologizing my whole life. I have said i'm sorry a million times. What else do you want? / Dave: Who SAID I want something? / Margaret: If you didn't want anything, we wouldn't be here. / Dave: What do YOU want? Do you want me to say "okay, i forgive you, i'm not mad anymore?" Because if it is, then... / Margaret: No. I want you to tell me why. What the Hell is THIS all about? / Dave: We don't need to dwell on whatever is bothering me. I'll be fine, eventually. So why don't we just let it go? / Margaret: Because if you don't tell me, i'm going to keep on hurting you unintentionally. Until i become your worst enemy. / Is that what you want? Would it make it easier for you?

Dave: Fine. I'm angry at you because you had sex with Roger. Because i'm possessive, and selfish, and all that. / Margaret: What do you think i am, stupid??? You know that's not the TRUTH, Dave. / Dave: Please, let's leave it like that. Please. / Margaret: I'm not sitting in the wet sand to hear bulls**t. / Dave: Don't make me say it. I don't want to say it, and you should... / Margaret: Remember my rule, Dave. / Dave: *sigh* Ugh. Okay. OKAY! / Dave: It goes like this. I spent YEARS. And i mean every MINUTE of them. Building you this... huge house inside my heart. / It had many little rooms where we could be silly, or naked, or sweet-sap corny. Or maybe we could just talk or fight or be together in silence. / Nothing was missing. Except you. So i waited. / But you never arrived, and the house started decaying. And i, i just couldn't STAND it. And so i burned it down and demolished the whole thing with a steamroller. / Dave: And suddenly... here you are, with your little suitcase. You find me standing among the ruins. / And then you ask me why i'm so sad. / And THEN you ask me why i'm ANGRY.  / [[Margaret reaches out to Dave]] / Dave: Don't.

Dave: Goddammit, i promised myself to stop doing this already... / Margaret: Dave... I'm... / Dave: If you say you're sorry again, i'm going to SCREAM.  / Margaret: I wasn't gonna say i'm sorry. I was gonna say i'm envious. / Dave: Okay. You have GOT to be kidding. / Margaret: No. I'm serious. You're very fortunate. / Dave: I wouldn't wish this kind of fortune on my worst enemy. / Margaret: Look. At least you have your pain. I... I am NUMB. You had your house and you have your ruins. You know what i got? / All i have is an iron tower. With your name scribbled -and scratched- all over the walls. / And since i can't get out, I'm not at your door with a suitcase. I never was.  / Margaret: I don't want a relationship, Dave. I know you're happy with someone else.  / But if we're going to be friends, you have to stop being mad at me. There's only one way to do that. / You have to start admitting it to yourself.  / You know. That fact that you still love me.

See, this aging, acclaimed film director meets a beautiful blue-haired heiress at a fancy party.  They have long talks about philosophy, death and literature. / Blue: Let me guess, the heiress falls for the director's smarts and they end up knocking boots. / Woody Allen: That would be a brilliant, brilliant twist. / Blue: Naw.

What's the big deal? / Mike: Maybe I don't LIKE talking to you.  You've got a one-track mind. / April: So what?  It's not like I *could* talk you into things, mmh? / Mike: What things?  I'm engaged to Marsha.  End of story.  There's no space for "things." / April: Hahah!  Well, you're what, 20???  And you're already committed for life, huh? / Mike: I don't expect my life to be that long, either. / April: More to my point, then!  Be honest.  Don't you ever think about the things you're missing out on? / Mike: Pfft!  Like what, you??? / April: Yes, Mike.  Me. / April: Have you ever considered you might like it? / April: Or are you simply afraid you would?

I'm too drunk to die right now! Marsha!!! / Marsha: HAHAH! So I notice! You had a really good time, didn't you? That makes me feel a little bit better about it! / April: But uh no FAIR I... ARGH! / Marsha: You made a very good choice there, April. Red REALLY suits you. You'd look even better if your dress was all red. But that can be fixed, don't you think? Well, don't you?

He was your friend, so it's only natural you... / Dave: Mike?  My friend?  That's a laugh.  With friends like that, who needs a dent in the middle of the skull? / Roger: That's a very unheathy attitude, Dave.  You should face your grief, instead of pretending you don't miss Mike. / Dave: You know, you're right.  I really wish Mike was alive.  So I could kill him again for managing to RUIN my life even when he's dead. / Roger: That's the spirit!  Twenty points for paradox.

I want to know where she is. Did you get her yet? Is she here? / Hazel: No, she's not. / Blue: I don't BELIEVE this! Why is she still free??? Why is she still alive, while Mike is ROTTING in the f#@%ing ground? WHY? / Hazel: Aw honey. I know you want your revenge. But believe me, you should never try that while you're angry. / Blue: Ma, I SWEAR... if you don't let me in this time... / Hazel: She's mine, Blue.

PINK. / Margaret: No, it's Marsha's. Roger doesn't have one. / Roger: Damn right I DON'T. Those things totally give you butt cancer. / Dave: Uh... can I have yours, then? / Margaret: C'mon Dave! This is DUMB. You spent a week in Mexico dressed as a nun and sporting a purse. How is this worse? / Dave: I'm just saying! Yours is black, isn't it? Why can't I have yours? / Margaret: Sorry, I wouldn't be caught DEAD with a cell phone this pink.

That sounds like him. / In that case, I'm never gonna find him by night, and not before I run out of gas. I hope I can even make it to the next station. / I should have never let him alone out here.

It is just past sunset, and the sky is a mottled purple-pink. A telephone pole to Blue's left holds up a flyer reading, "Belle Circus" and "Greatest Show on Earth." The flyer has flourishes at the top and bottom, and has a picture of a clown's head and neck ruffle next to the tagline. Another telephone pole is visible in the distance on the other side of the lot.]] {{There is no dialogue for this strip.}}

Sheesh, Dave's making you sleep on the couch now? or are you one of those feminist chicks that completely confuse males by getting offended when someone lets them have the good stuff? / Blue: Roger. Come closer to my fist so I can let you have the good stuff.  / Roger: Wow, it's like Mike never left. / Blue: I don't think Mike was shagging Dave, tho. / Roger: One of those feminist, really naive chicks.

You can't avoid it but you can turn on the armor.  For example, a big source of anger is their stupid faces.  So you wear big, opaque glasses so they don't notice you're looking elsewhere. / Dave: Okay... What if you have good eyesight? / Roger: Sunglasses?  Pirate patch?  Plastic bag over face?  This solves every other problem, too. / Dave: Uh, still not working... / Roger: That's right, because you have to tune out their stupid, whiny voices.  So you have to make them shut up without disturbing civilization. / Dave: And how do you do that? / Roger: Basically, you say all kinds of things, so they feel their wasting their time talking to you and you're probably a dangerous loon. / Dave: Wait a minute... / Roger: You're slacking on the hump massage.

No, don't worry. I've got Franklin here. Be ready with the glue, of course, just in case. / Vernon: No, I made the winged girl punch the werewolf and I stuck her to the wall again. Both are neutralized. I know, I should just give me a raise, right? Just send me a dozen soldiers and we'll take them by surprise. / [[Vernon finishes his earpiece conversation and heads down the corridor.]] / Vernon: All this peeking behind the wall was instructive, but it's time to get out there.

[[The members of NOES are inside a bedroom on Dundun Island. The scene is from Dave's point of view.]] / Margaret: Uh-huh. You can see now, so you're leaving. / Dave: I woulda left sooner if I knew where I WAS. / Margaret: Fine. Then, you're out of NOES. / Dave: WHAT? You can't DO that! / Margaret: I'm still the leader. So let's take a VOTE. Mike? / Mike: Um... sorry, guy. The political situation is pretty delicate, and this is not a good time for dissidence. If you want, you can be a satellite member. Like Blue? / Roger: I'm not saying you suck, because really, you don't. But you have issues, man. You have enough problems already. And you're not too good at teamwork, and... / Roger: Okay, so you DO suck. But I'm voting you out because I worry deeply. Yes, that's it.

They got YOU out of the coma! / Mike: I was never in a coma. I was just brain-dead. / Roger: You still ARE. / Mike: Shut it, Roger. / Marsha: So what, you got out of it by yourself? / Mike: Basically, yeah. I think you helped me with it, too. / Margaret: Well, I don't see where's the good news. / Mike: Um.

What do you think he'll do when he finds out we made a deal with Damascus? / Roger: Throw a hissy fit, as always. Whine for a while. Pout. Not much else. / Margaret: Oh, I see where you're going. Yeah, it's going to be really hard to convince him. / Mike: To be honest, I don't think we will be able to. / Roger: Now that's positive thinking, folks. / Mike: Seriously. We can try. But it's a lost cause. / Margaret: You know what, I bet if Blue and I gang up on him, we can. / Mike: Oh yeah? Did you girls gang up on him to stay off Dundun Island when he was broken in the first place? / Margaret: ... Yeah. / Mike: Did it work. / Margaret: Okay. Okay, I see what you mean. Then what? / Mike: It's simply a matter of choosing, Margaret. / Mike: If he doesn't cooperate with Dundun Island, then he has to stop using his lasers for good. / Mike: That means, for starters, that he can't be a member of NOES anymore. / Margaret: Um. / Mike: If he wakes up this time, do you want to try a second?

We'll need to be out of his life for a while, I'm afraid. / Marsha: This is just crazy talk. Just crazy. / Margaret: What do you mean, "out" of his life? / Mike: Dave needs to move somewhere else.

I remember EVERYTHING you said when I was in a coma. All about kicking me out. / Mike: Dude, I know. You told us last time. Why couldn't you just wait to remember? / Dave: Never mind THAT. You wanted me out of NOES. Why? / Mike: I didn't. But like I said, it's politics. We HAD to cooperate with Dundun Island. I couldn't afford the rest of NOES siding with you. / Dave: And you just manipulated them into doing what you wanted. So YOU. / Mike: It's not what I wanted, Dave. I simply had NO CHOICE. / Dave: BULL[[obscured]]. / Mike: No, really. Here's why. First, my Dad is DEAD. Blue and I are still minors. That means we're more vulnerable than ever. / Dave: Uuuh... yeah. Okay. You... you know that was not my fault, right? / Mike: Uh-HUH. Whatever. Second, my mother is pregnant. That means I don't have the same leverage with her against Damascus. / Dave: The Dragon is PREGNANT??? I bet it's the Antichrist. / Mike: Ha. Ha. Ha.

I wouldn't have left NOES! We're losing her to the dark side! / Mike: Yeaaaaah. Like THAT was gonna happen. / Dave: What the Hell is that supposed to mean??!! / Mike: Psh, as if you didn't KNOW. You have a bit of a problem listening to reason, Dave. That's all. / Dave: Oh, that is SO NOT TRUE! / Mike: Dave, you INSISTED on infiltrating Dundun Island. Margaret ordered you out of it. She was RIGHT. What did you do? / Dave: That is so unfair! I was trying to protect her! And BLUE! Your sister? Remember her? / Mike: Exactly my point. Look, Dave.
