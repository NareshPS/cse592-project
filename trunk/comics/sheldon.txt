Here, you get a creme brulee made from Mongolian yak's milk. / NARRATOR: Any restaurant that puts the name of the chef on the menu (as if you'd know it from the bus boy's name).  Here, you get one mint leaf, sprinkled with caramelized, 100-year, French sea salt. / NARRATOR: Any restaurant that lists the chef's name, and it's just one weird word, like "Fandango".
