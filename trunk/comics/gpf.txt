If you killed your own grandfather, how can you exist to alter time in the first place? / {{Empress Trudy smiles wickedly}} / Empress Trudy: So a paradox is a threat to _all_ of us, then, and _you_, young fool, have doomed those you sought to save! / {{Todd smiles triumphantly}} / Todd: Depends on how you look at it.

Just finished up a 14-hour IRC flame war with a certain Dr. Dieter Sigmar from MIT's Nuclear Research Department.  What a dweeb! / Fred: Take it to the hoop, Fooker! / [[Fooker and Fred walking amongst a collage of Klingon pictures.]] / Fooker: It all started when that dink Sigmar was claiming that the Klingon Civil War was by far the coolest thing in the Star Trek cannon and I politely reminded him of the Battle of the Wolf... / Fred: Those MIT jerks! / [[Fooker shooting a strategic glance at the "audience," while walking amongst Borg pictures.]] / Fooker: His lame rebuttal was that the Battle of the Wolf had very few lasting impacts besides the whole "Hugh" incident.  So I publicly questioned the size of his genitals and reminded him of the whole "First Contact" movie, which was a direct result of the Battle of the Wolf... / [[Shot of Fooker imagining a Klingon & a Borg with a cool "electric" background.]] / Fooker: Then he blathered on about how the Klingon Civil War was a dramatic showcase of an entire culture and how it showed how much of a Bad@$$ Worf was.  While I concurred with this in theory, I told him you can't even begin to compare an event that nearly destroyed the Federation, not to mention Earth, to a campaign that was essentially just the Duras Sisters trying to claim unfounded power... / [[Fooker walks around the apartment, while Fred looks out the window.]] / Fooker: And it's so obvious that the whole "Son of Duras" thing was just pandering to the masses at best.  And after about 14 hours of this, my fingers started to hurt so I told him that the doctors over at Berkley call him "Pixie-butt" behind his back and logged out. / Fred: Hey, some guys in radiation suits just dropped something off at the front door... / [[Fooker opened the box addressed to him to find a large device, packed in packing peanuts, with radiation symbols all over it, and a clock-mechanism.  Fooker reads the note that came with it...]] / Fooker (reading): You have 15 minutes to decipher the code locking the deactivation panel before you turn into a radioactive hole in the ground.  Love, Pixie-butt... / Fred: You're on your own, man... I'm spending the night in the composting heap...

Even the horses were ravaged:  the foul beasts had been thorough. / Narrator:  Worse yet, the Captain's signet was taken as well.

[[The younger Glowerhausens meet at an anti-war rally]] / Trudy {{describing}}: For all intents and purposes, I was a mistake.  My mother, in her youthful ignorance, married my father after meeting him at an anti-war rally.  I came soon after. / [[Mrs. Glowerhausen angrily observes Mr. Glowerhausen lounging and young Trudy playing]] / Trudy {{describing}}: My mother inherited a small fortune, and upon readjusting her life, proceeded to grow it.

I'm selling it all and having a solid gold casket made. / Trudy: Gee, thanks, Mom. / Mrs. Glowerhausen: The last thing he needs is more cash to squander, and I don't trust YOU.

Trudy: I have a SISTER?! / Mrs. Glowerhausen: Sigh.  Yes, you have a little sister.  I gave her up for adoption right after she was born. / Mrs. Glowerhausen: She has no idea who her birth parents are, and I want to keep it that way.  So don't try to find her.  For all purposes, she doesn't exist. / Trudy: B-but why did you get rid of her? / Mrs. Glowerhausen: Because your father wanted another child and I didn't.  So I took an extended "business trip," had her, and came back.  He never knew. / Trudy: I thought you had a hysterectomy... / Mrs. Glowerhausen: This was before then.  Let's just say there was copious amounts of alcohol involved...

Nick: What do you mean by Dexter's "invisible phase?" / Sharon: Deep down, Dex is a very shy, insecure person. / Sharon: He never really had many friends, so he isn't very socially adept. He tends to over compensate by smothering people. When that fails, he tends to withdraw from everyone. / Ki: I don't remember this... / Sharon: That's because you didn't date him as long as I did. I saw him do it at his last job. / Sharon: We need to interact with him and draw him out of his shell. / Ki: Personally, I enjoy the level of interactivity with him right now...

Why don't *you* lure him there? / Sharon: Because every time he has a remotely romantic thought about me, Fooker programmed him to fall in love with Megan Morrone, remember? / Ki: GRRR... / Sharon: I'll handle the entertainment.

A job won't just fall in your lap. / Fred:  And what sort of job do you suggest I look for, hm? Who will hire a slime mold with no formal education or experience? / Ki:  Um, right.  We need to find your a job where you don't have to talk to anyone face to face. / Persephone:  Good.  He doesn't have a face.

No one can tell from his voice he's a slime mold. / Ki: True, but he'd still have to interview, so that won't work. / [[Ki sits back up.  Nick sticks his tongue out, trying to improve his dexterity.]] / Persephone: What if he interviews with someone who already knows he's a slime mold? / Ki: But who-- / Ki: THAT'S IT! / [[Nick jumps, making his screwdriver slip and cross circuits, providing him with a big jolt, on top of the added surprise of Ki's screaming.]] / <

I'll e-mail you the dates. / Craig: Make sure to get a passport far in advance.

Guys, this is Craig Ridge, an old college friend of mine. / Sharon: What exactly were you two doing here? / Nick: We didn't know who that guy was, so we followed you to make sure you were okay. / Sharon: And what was that outburst all about? / Dexter: I thought that he was hitting on you.  I mean, when strange girls take Nick somewhere, Ki spies on them... / Craig: You mean you people always spy on each other when a new person comes along? / Nick: It's kind of a tradition... / Sharon: A very bad one.

You told us you destroyed "Velociraptor" and all plans associated with it! / Nick: I did! / Nick: But I made some modifications to the Mutex, and I didn't have a power source strong enough, so I kind of rebuilt VR... from memory. / Nick: In the process, I think I fixed the electromagnetic interference, so it will no longer black out the entire city.

Yet I am driven to aid those in peril, who cling to life by the thinnest of threads, many of whom will never remember my name. / [[View of a patient in the room with the window]] / Akhilesh: Somehow...

His skills have also surpassed all those in the brotherhood that he went up against.  These alone point to his prowess... / Scott: But "thePROPH3T" found a series of trials that would show us clearly if he is destined for glory. / Patty: Whatever.  Let's get this over with then. / Tim: Wait a minute... you're interested in joining and helping us now? / Patty: Not really, but it beats doing real work...

What have we got? / William: About four PDP-11/94s, a small Vax 6000 cluster, and a couple of Apple IIe's we can use for terminals. / Fooker: You have got to be joking... / William: I wish I were. / Fooker: Fine.  Order three large "everything" pizzas and a six-pack of Red Bull, then download the latest Linux kernel source.  I've got some cables to splice... / Tim: Do you really think even the one could turn that into a powerful modern server cluster? / Scott: Only if you believe in miracles, Tim... / Patty: Oh, I can just smell the drama...

You preach diversity while slowly blending your genes to conformity! / [[Mr. Oshiro picks up his cane]] / Nick: And this comes from a Japanese man who married a Chinese woman?  How does that make you exempt from your own bigotry? / Mr. Oshiro: That.. is... enough!

He takes what little he gleans from cartoons and pretends to know our ways and culture! / Ki: That sounds nothing like Nick!  If anything, I'd bet he spend weeks, if not months, doing research, trying to find ways to honor you.  He knew you highly valued Japanese culture and wanted to show an interest in it. / Mr. Oshiro: Then he should have researched more!

They adjust more quickly than other women to the corporate world, usually by taking leadership roles. / Trent: But if two strong-willed women are placed on the same team, they often clash and create conflict.  Strong willed men, on the other hand, simply fall into line. / Nick: You don't actually believe all that, do you, Trent? / Trent: Eh, who knows?  But there COULD be a kernel of truth to it all... / Sharon: Look, this is MY project, so we'll do it MY way! / Ki: Even though YOUR way is so obviously WRONG? / Dexter: [[cowering]] Mommy?

I had this silly, crazy dream last night, and it got me thinking about... well, US. / Sharon: I'm beginning to LIKE this dream... / Fooker: Er, you might NOT. It didn't exactly paint you in the most flattering light. / Sharon: This isn't the one with me dressed up in plastic wrap while spanking Ed McMahon with a sausage while you're dancing "Swan Lake" in the nude again, is it? / Fooker: Fortunately, No.

You see less of what ill the world has done to you and more of what you have done to it.  That is the first step in finding forgiveness. / Akhilesh: I cannot heal your spirit, Trudy.  I have done all that I can for your body, but that is all I can do.  But I can point you in the right direction. / [[He offers her a copy of the Bible]] / Akhilesh: I feel you need to appeal to a higher power.  Only then will you finally find peace. / {{Author's notes below the panel: "Some people may be confused by Akhilesh's reaction to Trudy's story. After all that we know she has done, how could anyone think to forgive her? Here's a few references that may explain his reaction: Matthew 7:1-5, Luke 6:37, Romans 14:4 and 14:10-13, 1 Corinthians 4:3-5 and 5:12-13, and James 4:11-12."}}

I expect you to find the answer to your *greatest* need: *forgiveness*.  With all you have done, you may never find it from man, nor may you forgive yourself. But "if we confess our sins," God "is faithful and just and will forgive us." / Trudy: Like God would care about me, with all I've done... / Akhilesh: "He is patient with you, not wanting everyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance." / Trudy: What I've done is too terrible to forgive! / Akhilesh: "As far as East is from West, so far has He removed our transgressions from us." / Trudy: There's nothing I can do to atone for what I've done! / Akhilesh: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast." / Trudy: You are *beyond* irritating, do you know that? / Akhilesh: Perhaps, but I can keep this up all day if I must... / {{Author's notes below the comic: "Panel Two: 1 John 1:9. See also Ephesians 1:7 and Hebrews 8:12. Panel Three: 2 Peter 3:9. Panel Four: Psalm 103:11-12, although Luke 1:37 would be a more direct (and shorter) response. Panel Five: Ephesians 2:8-9."}}

Sharon and Dex may remember that. / Nick: Later, when I hooked it up to the Velociraptor power supply, it acted strangely, as if it transported Ki and me into an alternate reality.  Then I found out it really DID. / Nick: Since then, I've been observing other dimensions and making modifications, perfecting the reality matrix until I'm now positive that interdimensional travel is not only REAL but can even be SAFE. / Nick: Would you believe I found an Earth where the Statue of Liberty is only 151 feet tall?

I didn't know we would end up near the end of the Mobius Wave Gem saga.  I *thought* we'd encounter Sinister Stan, or Apogee, or even Chrono-Monk.  *Not* Warmonger, and *especially* not in his most powerful form.  I just thought it would be fun to act out some old super hero fantasies and include my friends in it.  I... I guess I didn't input the right parameters in the MUTEX's reality matrix. / Nick:  As for the Speck, I don't know where *he* comes from.  He's not one of *my* characters.  He did say something about his "own universe," so maybe he crossed a dimensional boundary and ended up in our pocket universe by mistake. / The Inexplicable Speck!:  "Pocket Universe?"  Wait a minute...  This is all starting to come together... / The Inexplicable Speck!:  The Gamester said some guy named Nick *thought* he had created a "pocket" universe, but really linked with an existing one his subconscious had tapped into.  If you're that Nick, maybe your comics were really an expression of *real* events occurring *here.* / Nick:  That... *could* be possible... / Ki, shaken, thinks:  The Gamester? / The Warmonger, pointing a humongous gunhand at The Inexplicable Speck! and Nick:  You geeks yap too much. / The Warmonger:  Yer time's up.

My super speed gave out during Nick's apology speech. / Dexter:  Gave out? / The Inexplicable Speck!:  My powers are tied to the unstable half-life of a new type of radiation I discovered. / The Inexplicable Speck!:  Thus, when the half-life expires, my powers change.

If you "created" this guy and you know his weaknesses, now would be a good time to share them! / Nick:  Ordinarily, the Warmonger is just a guy in a big metal battle suit.  The Team could easily defeat him on even terms. / Nick:  But as long as he has the Mobius Wave Gem, we *can't* defeat him.  That's why he stole it! / Nick:  The Mobius Wave was created by an ancient alien race called the Elorinians.  With their advanced technology, they created a new perpetual energy source to replace their dying sun.  Like a Mobius Strip, the Wave is endless with no beginning or end.  Some say the Elorinians did not *create* the Wave, but they were the only ones to tap into it and harness its limitless power. / Nick:  Ten thousand years ago, the evil sourcerer Deglok the Despicable sought to harness the Mobius Wave's power from any location.  So he created a gem to focus time and space to the Wave's coordinates.

Ki: Oh, Sharon!  I didn't mean anything by that "convicted felon" crack... / Sharon: I know... I'm just shocked my Mom's name showed up in the FBI's database. / Ki: Does it say what she's accused of? / Sharon: I'm not sure.  The public records don't seem very exhaustive. / Sharon: However, "Esther Matusevitch" looks like only one of many aliases this woman has used over the years.  There's got to be twenty or more "AKA's" in this list. / Ki: It looks like your search just took an exponential leap in complexity... / Sharon: Assuming I'm even on the right path to begin with...

How goes the Mom search? / Sharon: Well, using publicly available records, I managed to link a number of those aliases to a pattern of movement that does put "Esther" in the right city when I was born. / Sharon: I also managed to dig deeper at the FBI to show that she's been in the money laundering business for decades.  And she's good at it: usually, when the Feds crack one scheme, she's already two steps ahead of them. / Ki: So NOW what are you going to do? / Sharon: Pull a few favors from my hacker friends, do some cracking myself, and solve this mystery once and for all.

We have remained underground ever since. / Scott: Both fragments have been diligently seeking "The One," an uber hacker who will revolutionize the online world.  The prophecy was discovered during a complex analysis of usenet's archives. / Scott: They believe we have been too radical in the search, looking for candidates that they would quickly dismiss.  But we think we have found The One, or at least two of the most promising prospects. / Sharon: And who would that be? / Patty: This would be the point where meaningful glances are exchanged, revelations are dawned, and I get to say, "Well, Duh," right?

It must process all of the usenet archive, not just a portion, and in the original ASCII, not unicode. / Fooker: Well, he gets brownie points for obfuscated C code.  Here's the problem: He's got a "count++" when he ought to use "++count".  Right, Sharon? / Sharon: Yeah.

Now all those distributed machines are doing our work, at least for a little while... / Scott: If you are not The One, I will still be humbled by your presence... / Sharon: Well, while we're waiting, maybe you can explain something.  If this process looks at all of usenet, what about recent posts?  Won't those change the results? / Scott: Not necessarily, but I understand your reasoning.  Our experiences, however, show that new posts only serve to clarify the results, just as more data in a high resolution image yields a sharper picture. / Scott: Perhaps the analogy to the "Bible Code" was not entirely accurate, as the Bible is a static document while usenet is always evolving... / Patty: Here's one, since we're playing twenty questions... / Patty: What's stopping Fooker and Sharon from rigging the code so they'll be a perfect match on your tests? / Sharon: Since neither of us wants to be "The One", I'd be more concerned about the opposite...

We *thought* you failed, but because an *insatiably* curious person would drop everything to find the answer. / Scott: But since you *did* look at it eventually, then you *are* curious, and you pass that test!

Mostly a little new employee hazing.  All harmless. / Mercedes: Is it true you were reprimanded by your employer for these practical jokes? / Trent: Yes.

But most damaging is the last one, that the plaintiff is a "homicidal maniac." / Mercedes: Mr. Terrell, out of curiosity, ARE you a homicidal maniac? / Trent: Absolutely not!  That's completely absurd!  I've never murdered anyone! / Mercedes: Yet the defendant claims you are.

There's no direct interface between that database and the Eelorian computer.  We keep it separate for our OWN security. / Kyoko [Ki]: But Dex's sweep DID trigger a small piece of embedded code, deep in our system, that has been laying dormant for several years.  I find it interesting that its timestamp corresponds with our first Eelorian computer link up.

Ned [Nick]: You're implying the Eelorians implanted a backdoor into our computer when they first established the link with us? / Trentoc [Trent]: Preposterous! / Kyoko [Ki]: Not implying; proving!  I checked all system backups prior to and after the link, and it never existed before.  The code executes a clever but harmless bypass of Eelorian security protocols.  Enough to raise an alarm on cue. / Kyoko [Ki]: My suspicion is that they put this Trojan in our system as an ace in the hole, with no specific use in mind, but convenient in the off chance it might be needed.  The magistrate knew of its existence, but I doubt few below his rank would. / Kyoko [Ki]: My guess is that he became frustrated by our legal salvage rights to the alien ship outside their space, and used the Trojan to simulate a hack when he learned of Dexlar's probe.  Then he could cry foul and seize Dex and the ship.

Kyoko's evidence seems valid to me. / Ducan [Dwayne]: With no real intrusion by Dexlar into your computer, your criminal extradition claim has no merit.  Thus, OUR salvage claim still holds, as enforced by the very treaty you religiously cling to, T'rel. / Trentoc [Trent]: My government will not stand for this treachery! / Ned [Nick]: On the contrary, I suspect they'll be so embarrassed by your mishandling of this that they'll backpedal quicker than a Rigellian razorback. / Ducan [Dwayne]: It wouldn't surprise me if they relieved you of your post, Magistrate. / Trentoc [Trent]: Laugh while you can, General.

But without a power core, you won't get far, and we can't exactly harness a black hole for you. / Dexlar [Dex]: The voyage home would be long and... lonely.  My creators most likely already assumed our ship was lost.

The descriptions are pretty vivid. / Ki: You can tell that the characters are well developed in your head.

You're up! / Josh: Be right back. / Sam: Hi!  Let's see... it's Ki, right? / Ki: Yeah.  Josh says you're Sam. / Sam: It's great that you're helping Josh out.  He's a cool guy, a big teddy bear.  But his math skills are abysmal, and the coach won't let him play if his grades slip too much. / Ki: He's doing okay.  He just has trouble grasping certain concepts.  Some people are wired differently than others.  I used to golf with my dad, but I'm much more comfortable in front of a computer. / Sam: Well, thanks.

That left Dad's approval. / Ki: [[narrating]] Dad, of course, was not as warm as Mom.  He had hoped I would have found an Asian boy to settle down with, but with some gentle prodding from Mom, he seemed to accept Sam... Especially when he heard how much his dad made. / Ki: [[narrating]] Mind you, Dad was a bit more open-minded then.

He was a self-made man, who obviously worked hard to be where he was.  To that end, he had little problem with my more humble origins, but he was very traditional, and a strong woman was not someone he had a lot of experience with. / Ki: [[narrating]] The entire weekend was awkward.

[[Sandra walks by while Ki talks with two cheerleaders]] / Ki narrating: The scuttlebutt had Sandra, the cheer squad's resident matress with hair, "servicing" Sam to make up for my "short-comings." Sandra, of course, was conveniently nowhere to be found. / [[Josh sees Sam with Sandra]] / Ki narrating: Nanese didn't believe the rumor, but Josh said he saw Sam and Sandra flirting after the last night's game. Sandra flirted with everyone, though, and I'm not going to go ballistic over something as simple as that. / [[Ki approaches Sam]] / Ki narrating: I was very cautious when I broached the topic with Sam. I calmly made it clear I wasn't accusing. I just wanted the truth. And he swore to me he hadn't slept with her, and he seemed completely sincere. / [[Ki embraces Sam]] / Ki narrating: I wasn't sure I believed him. If it WAS a lie, it was a good one. But whether it was guilt or shock that I even thought he'd cheat on me, I could tell it hurt him, and I never wanted to hurt him again.

Sometimes to the point that you can't see the obvious. / Nick: Well, you're not the only one who tends to overlook glaring character flaws. / Ki: No, that's different.  You always try to find the best in people, even when it's deeply buried.  It's your gift and curse. / Ki: I only saw the man I fell in love with and was blinded to his changes that others saw.  I could tell he was stressed.  But I was so caught up in trying to buildhim up that I failed to see him tearing me down. / Ki: Near the end, I started to blame himself for his problems.

Some had Sam cheating on me, others had me cheating on him (with Fooker!). I didn't care, and Sam never said anything either, mostly I think because he was embarassed that Fooker kicked his butt. / [[Fooker walks with Ki as they pass Sam, whose face has an expression of silent regret]] / Ki narrating: Fooker wouldn't let me walk alone for a long time.

He assumed that since his daughter's fiance didn't get what he wanted, daddy would make a good target for revenge. / [[Ki's father looks out a window]] / Ki narrating: There was never any proof to support his theory, of course, but that never stopped him.

To Thine Own Self...: Chapter One / I can't believe it! Your wedding is in only a few days! This is so exciting! / Trust me, I know. / So we're going to pick up your family, drop your dad and brother at the hotel, and we and your mom will head to the church. Is that right? / Yeah. And as soon as Lori and Nick's mom reach town, they'll join us. / I can't believe you're this calm! I'd be a nervous wreck by now! / Oh, I am nervous. I'm just too busy and overwhelmed to show it. / Mama! Papa! Welcome! / Aiya! so this is Sharon we hear so much about! / The ticket says "meal," written in plain English. What do we get? Cheese and crackers! That is no meal! and in-flight movie? "Herbie: Fully Loaded!"

Hola, Senor and Senora Wellington! I'm Jason, but all my pals call me Fooker. I'm your son's best man and your chauffeur for today. / Such an... interesting nickname you have there. / It's a long story involving metasyntactic variables, a fish, and copious amounts of alcohol. It's best left to ancient history. / But your chariot awaits to whisk you away to your h0tel and eventually to the church. / Is that your car? It seems nicer than what Nick described. / Actually, this is my girlfriend's. For some reason, she refused to let me pick you up in my car. I mean, it still has four wheels and a motor. That's all we really need, right?

Hey, Fooker! I assume you got Mom and Dad here safe and sound? / Yeah, but you could have warned me. / Warned you? About what? / That your dad's a cop!

They have aboslutely nothing in common save that their child is marrying into a totally unknown family. / I know Mrs. Wellington has been so nice to me, but how will she react to my mom? and Mama's usually so sweet, but she has a fiery tempter. What if... if they...? / Get introduced by Nick while you ramble on? / I seriously doubt there's going to be any explosions... / Still you're just tall enough to be an effective blast shield.

I like how you're keeping things simple, Ki. It sure makes decorating quicker and easier. / Well, I thought that since this church is so pretty on its own, why add too much to it?

I thought some of them were supposed to be helping us... / I set them to a task that will keep them out of our hair... / So now that we've run the ethernet, this machine will act as the central hub for all streaming audio and video to the Web.

Ki! / I know this is somewhat last minute, but can I be one of your bridesmaids? / Um, Persephone, usually it's the bride that asks, not the other way around. And I've already got three bridesmaids. / Sharon's my maid of honor, and Nicole and Nick's sister are the others. If we added you, the party would be uneven. / I thought Fred was going to be a groomsman... / I think Nick offered, but he wanted to maintain a low profile to avoid the paparazzi. / Then can I be the flower girl? / I'm sorry, but I've already asked Sydney to be our flower girl. / But... but I so much wanted to be a part of your wedding... / Perseffome can be my co-flower girl if she wants to! / Ooh!

[[TO THINE OWN SELF...: CHAPTER TWO]] / Ki: GAH! I AM RUNNING _SO_ LATE! SHARON, ONE OF THESE DAYS. I'M GOING TO GET YOU BACK FOR KEEPING ME OUT LAST NIGHT! / Sharon: JUST THINK OF IT AS PREPARATION FOR TONIGHT. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'LL BE GETTING ANY SLEEP... / Ki: POOR NICK IS GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT. I'LL BE CRANK CALLING YOU ALL NIGHT LONG. / Nicole: ISN'T THIS FUN, DWAYNE?

YOU CAN DO THIS. IT'S JUST A WEDDING. IT'S NOT EVEN _YOURS_. SO WHAT ARE THE ODDS YOU'LL SCREW THIS ONE UP TOO?

Have any of you seen him? / Dwayne: Not since the bachelor party. / Dexter: That's odd... He's not answering his phone. Maybe he's en route. / Fooker: Hold on, I'll try his cell phone... / Dwayne: He's not answering? / Fooker: Little guy's probably a bundle of nerves and forgot to turn it on.

It hasn't been the same since you "retired."  But seeing Murphy in action tells me you probably ended up on the right path. / [[Fooker and Maddie continue their conversation.

[[The wedding reception.  At the upper right, Ki, smiling, descends a staircase followed by Nick.  Ki is in her wedding gown.  Nick has removed his jacket and is wearing a ruffly white shirt, black trousers, and green vest and bow tie.  At the foot of the staircase, to their left, Fooker addresses the crowd, looking back over his shoulder and gesturing with his left thumb toward Ki and Nick.  He is dressed like Nick, with his jacket off.  Behind Fooker to his right (stage left) is a table that holds something tall that could be the cake, a punch fountain, or a stack of wedding presents.  Behind the banister of the staircase is some sort of shrubbery.  In front of Ki, Nick, and Fooker is a crowd, mostly facing the happy couple.  Most of the heads are gray and indistinct, but the recognizable ones include Otto Wisebottom (Nick's uncle),  Charles Wellington (Nick's father), Wallace T. Bruin, Tim and Scott (formerly of the Brotherhood of the Twisted Pair).  Slightly closer, in partial profile, are Sharon, Ki's mother, and Linda Wellington (Nick's mother).  Yoshi, facing away from the staircase, appears to be eating something, bringing a spoon to his mouth.  In the foreground are Patty, still looking jaded, and Agent #18, partially facing each other.  Between them, Sydney, in her flower girl dress, smiles down at Persephone, who is still wearing her flower "girl" veil and sitting on a table next to Fred.

They go about their self-important existences, seeing mortals as nothing but insignificant specks in the unpleasant but necessary plumbing of the cosmos. / Mischief: But one thing I've learned from the Gamester--and it was a hard lesson for me--is that it is *we* who are here for *your* benefit, and not the reverse. The extra-dimensional realms are a support structure to keep the mortal metaverse intact. / Mischief: Mortals are what give the cosmos purpose to exist. What that purpose is is debatable, but it's clear that your tiny lives, at least in summation, are why *we* exist. Most entities have forgotten that, including other guardians like us. / Mischief: But there are a few, like the Gamester and Justice, who realize just how precious mortality is and have pledged themselves to protect it.  What's more frightening are those who see mortals' importance... and seek to *destroy* it.

Don't mind him, but I wouldn't advise any sudden moves. / Dwayne: O....kay. / Fred: Dwayne, you've been very good to me, giving me a job when the university dumped me, standing by me through the Trent fiasco...

I'm happy he's doing so well, but afraid it's going to his... um... nucleus. / Nick: It seems to me most of his celebrity is based on the novelty of his uniqueness. Once the media has had its fill of him, I think he'll get dumped onto the D-List with former child actors and American Idol rejects. / Ki: How is Fooker taking the attention focused on his apartment? / Sharon: He's been cool to the molds lately, ever since we got back from the alternate universe.

[[Harmony types away at her computer]] / Harmony: According to Wikipedia, the Napier's Bones was an abacus created by John Napier in 1617 for the calculation of product and quotients.  But the hacker-only version has a bit more. / Harmony: According to legend, Napier also postulated the universal algorithm, a unifying mathematical formula to explain the universe.  With it, a hacker could theoretically control anything.  Napier supposedly encoded this algorithm into the bones themselves, but only his own models, which he designed himself. / Harmony: The last known set of bones designed by Napier was recently removed from display for unspecified reasons.  They were said to be stored in an unnamed vault in Groklots... / Harry: Which was recently emptied by Dexter then broken into. / [[Harry leans on the table where Harmony and Donald are sitting]] / Harmony: We don't know that. / Harry: But it makes sense.  Dexter brought the bones here, and now you know who is coming to steal them.  If he figures out the algorithm, he could take over the world...

Besides, if Dumpingcore had Dexter bring the bones here, he must have thought this was a safe place to keep them. / Harmony: But Sysape is on the faculty.  Dumpingcore probably trusts him, which makes him a perfect mole. / Donald: Aye, he's even weaselly looking. / Harry: Still, we need to tell Dumpingcore directly. / [[Donald, Harmony, and Harry visit Prof McDongle (Patty) after changing clothes]] / Prof McDongle: Professor Dumpingcore?

Have you ever had an... intimate dream about someone... other than me?  Since we've been married? / Ki:  Not that I remember... wait a minute. / Ki:  Who was she?  Just so I can put a hit out on her if she comes within 50 yards of you. / Nick:  I know when you're joking, but the scowl is convincing.

I also know you're a terrible liar and you'd never be able to pull off an affair.  Dreams are just random neurons firing in your sleep.  It doesn't mean anything. / Nick:  I'm glad you see it that way.  We know each other too well to let something so trivial come between us.  I know who I love when I'm awake, and you'll always be the woman of my dreams. / Ki:  So now that we got that out of the way, now I want to know who she is.  Who could possibly make you so embarrassed? / Nick:  My look at the time, we'll be late for work.

No one's seen "Elsbeth Diederich" since. / Trudy:  Mom would have put the poison pill in place from the beginning.  The buyer might have changed, but she knew she would sell to someone.

She was a little younger than us, so she obviously wasn't Mom.  That threw me off.  But what if Mom took her with her wherever she went? / Trudy:  Mom doesn't trust men.  She often populates her "inner circle" with trusted, highly loyal young women.  There's a lot of churn there, but if someone were to show a high level of initiative... / Sharon:  I'll do a search of companies with unusually high concentrations of female upper management.

But nobody's more suspicious than a retired secret agent, and you set off all my old intuitions. / Fooker:  Maybe it's all my old experiences, but nobody knows "our" Trudy like I do.

Normally, I would bring this to your marketing chief, but since you're here, I'll let you take this to Dwayne. / [Jones appears contemplative and Nick re-seats his glasses] / Mr. Jones:  Say, who is your marketing man now?  Trudy went astray years ago, and there was that nasty bit with Trent's lawsuit... / Nick:  It's... complicated.

Dwayne: It's good to hear that Goodman Rubber is pleased with our progress. Anything else I need to hear? / Nick: Well there IS one more thing... / Nick: You may recall that Mr. Jones' son founded a web 2.0 start-up a while back. It didn't pan out, so he's starting from scratch. He's looking for experienced coders for a new venture. / Dwayne: Ah. Jones wants us to give him a kick-start. We've got a lull in our schedule, so we might be able to fit him in. / Nick: There's... Just one hitch... / Nick: It's a cross-platform mobile app. iPhone, Android, Blackberry... The works. / Dwayne: We don't do mobile apps. / Nick: We do now.

They've invited Trudy and me up for a week of meetings as well as a big awards dinner. / Dwayne:  Now I can't go; I'm meeting with Robey's Jungleworks that week.  So they insisted I send our chief architect, Nick, instead.  It's a big opportunity and could mean a lot more work going forward. / Dwayne:  I can't send Ki with her deadline looming.  So seeing as there's some... history among you three, I wanted to get things out before you go.  The last thing I want is some world domination plot or parallel universe shenanigans interfering with our bottom line.

[[Note from Jeff: Needs more descriptions of visuals]] / Ki:  Then why am I here? / Dwayne:  So you know this is on the level, that it's coming from me and not some "nefarious plot". / Ki:  Well... seeing as she's not exactly who I'd be nervous about... being from, well, somewhere else... / Trudy:  Maybe... maybe one of us could go alone, or we can send Fooker and Sharon... / Nick:  Look, we're adults and we're professionals.  Put bluntly, Trudy isn't the Trudy who was our nemesis so long ago.  She's proven to be faithful these past several years.  We would be honored to represent GPF to such an illustrious client.  Right ladies? / Trudy and Ki (reluctantly):  Right...

[[Note from Jeff: Needs more descriptions of visuals]] / Ki:  A full week alone with Trudy.  Just the drive alone takes eight hours.  What are you two even going to talk about? / Nick:  Sexual fetishes of marketing directors. / Ki:  Not funny.  I don't care if she's not "our" Trudy.  I still don't trust her. / Nick:  Neither do I.  That said, she hasn't kicked any puppies lately either. / Nick:  Look, we've made a lot of mistakes with trust in the past.  Trudy, Trish... but we've learned from those mistakes.  She's behaved herself the past few years.  I'll be open yet cautious. / Ki:  Still, I want you to be armed.  Maybe you can borrow something from Fooker.  A Taser, or maybe a bazooka... / Nick:  The "safe word" will be "monkeyshines".  That's when you'll know to call in the National Guard.

[[Note from Jeff: Needs more descriptions of visuals]] / Trudy (thinking):  A whole week alone with Nick, capped off with an elegant award dinner, too.  What should I wear?  What sort of signals, real or unintentional, will that choice send? / Trudy's shoulder demon:  This is finally our chance to swipe Nick right out from under Ki's nose!  Lure him in with as much leg and cleavage as possible then jump his bones when the moment's right! / Trudy's shoulder angel:  Absolutely not!  We've finally made headway restarting our life.  We've come so far!  We can't backslide now!  Ki won Nick fair and square, so he's strictly off limits. / Trudy:  Shoulder angels and demons?  Seriously?  Have we been finally reduced to that tired old cliche? / Trudy's shoulder demon:  Which would you rather have, mop top?  Us or the maniacal jester?

[[Note from Jeff: Needs more descriptions of visuals]] / Nick:  I know we haven't spent a lot of time alone together since...  well, since that whole parallel universe incident.  We've kept to ourselves, and that's probably been for the best. / Nick:  We each have unresolved issues with our universes' counterpart of the other, and those will likely never be resolved.  But I'm not your emperor and you're not the woman who used and manipulated me. / Nick:  So let's just get this out in the open and be done with it:  No lies or judgments between us, agreed?  We have a fresh start, so we should start off as friends and colleagues.  That past does not exist for either of us. / Trudy:  Fooker didn't have a little talk with you before we left, did he? / Nick:  No.  Why? / Trudy:  Oh, no reason...

I also told her that in spite of all she had done to me and my friends, I forgave her.  You both deserved a fresh start. / Trudy:  I... I don't know what...

The elevator is to your right, while the pool is to your left. / Nick:  Too bad the sun's going down.  The pool's probably closing.  If I recall correctly, you're a pretty good swimmer. / Trudy:  I'm sure they have lights.  Care for a dip? / Nick:  Nah, I need to log in and check some e-mails.

It originally meant "locksmith". / Nick:  How the heck did you know that. / Trudy:  Oh, sorry.  It's my mother.  She... had a gift for languages, as does Sharon's mom.  I guess I absorbed some of it by association. / Nick:  Fascinating.  So what's Hungarian for "good night"? / Trudy:  Jo Ejszakat... I think. / Nick:  I won't risk spraining my tongue.  Good night, Trudy.

[[Note from Jeff: Needs more descriptions of visuals]] / Trudy (thinking):  What can't I sleep?  Why can't I stop thinking about him?  Why can't I just let him go? / Trudy (thinking):  I lost him years ago, when I betrayed him and went mad with lust for power.  In my head I know he would never accept me, and I've come to terms with that.  But why can my heart -- or my loins -- get with the program? / Trudy (thinking):  I'll bet he hasn't even thought about us.  About what he could be doing right now with me and without Ki.  I wonder what is exactly going through his head right now... / Nick is shown dreaming of cryptography related programming source code.

What an interesting name.  German, I presume... / Trudy:  And I presume you are related to the Fedek Lakatos, the company's founder...? / Adrienn Lakatos:  He was my great-grandfather.  He grew his little apothecary shop into the world conglomerate it is today.

You've been distracted ever since we left Lakatos. / Trudy: Hmm? / Trudy: It's... probably nothing. It's that girl Adrienn. Something's not right about her. I can't put my finger on it, but she keeps setting off warning sirens in my head. / Nick: Ah, those old freedom-fighter instincts. You know, not everyone is an imperial stormtrooper or alien puppet bent on world conquest. Some people actually _/don't/_ have a hidden agenda. / Trudy: Oh, _she_ does. I can feel it. I just wish I could figure out _what_. / Nick: Perhaps it's as mundane as tricking us into a lopsided contract. After all we've been through, wouldn't _/that/_ be a hoot.
