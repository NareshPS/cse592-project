It exploded instantly. / Gav: Yeah, well Teri will be back! / Danny: How do you know? / Gav: She's not ready for the Internet. / Teri: Okay, I've learned that Pamela Anderson is the queen, Bill Gates now owns 51% of me, & a muppet killed JFK.

You can't just march around killing animal rights activists! / Gav: I'm not killing them! / Gav: I'm just trying to introduce them to the benefits of modern medical science. / Suzy: But Gav! What IF you kill someone? / Gav: It's okay! I plan to release one lab rat for everyone who dies. That way, it all evens out.

Dr.Goldfinger: Students, your final term paper projects will be to complete various research projects that I can't afford to pay graduate students to do. You will wite them in a standard two-column publishable format with my name, Dr. Goldfinger, listed as the primary author. / Dr.Goldfinger: Do not put your own name on the paper. Attaching your S.I.D. number on a post-it will be sufficient. The due date will be one week before my next professional conference. Grades are base on the difficulty of the questions I'm asked at said conference. / Suzy: We're paying HOW much per semester to do his research for him? / Danny: Cheer up, Suzy Gee. Just think about his reaction at the conference when he finds out I'm taking this class pass/not pass. / {{Contraction!}}

You're a concept? / Gav: I'm in love with a concept? / Ma'at: Oh Gav, I may be just a concept. But I'm still a girl! / Gav: We do have a word for you, Ma'at ...perfect! / Ma'at: Oh Gav!

We're together again!  I missed you so much! / Ma'at:  You didn't miss me just a second ago ... / Gav:  Just please tell me you or I are here to stay!  Tell me we'll be together forever! / Ma'at:  H'OKIE DOKIE! / Gav:  Wow.  That's SO not the answer to which I'm accustomed!

Ma'at:  Tee hee.  So I'm a "goddess," am I? / Gav:  Oh right, I'm sorry -- you're more the "personification of an idea" ... / Ma'at:  Nah, let's stick with "goddess."  It's easier and it impresses the valkyries.  So you're in love with me? / Gav:  I know we only spent that short time together in the afterlife and maybe I was feeling vulnerable from being dead and all, but you were everything I wanted in life (no offense).  You were like my ... my ... / Ma'at:  "Soul" mate? / Gav:  ... Self!

Danny:  I do not understand.  I attached Gav's laptop to the server and now the hard drive will not stop spinning. / Suzy Gee:  Is maybe someone else messing with it? / Danny:  I shall check the FTP logs. / Danny:  It appears Gav himself is downloading a number of files to his account.  He must be sitting right over there. / Suzy Gee:  Uh ... ? / Danny:  He MUST be.  Please do not make me look.

There's an unusually large velociraptor chasing me. / Ma'at:  How exotic! / Ma'at:  Do you often have dinosaur trouble down here? / Gav:  No, usually just an ant problem. / Ma'at:  So where do we hide? / Gav:  I'm thinking we climb a tree in that dank dank forest. / Ma'at:  This is a fun date: / Gav:  Oh sure.

Jesus:  Hidey ho, new and continuing Cal students!  I'm Jesus Christ, Devourer of Souls, here to bring you up to date on the goings on of Nukees! / Jesus:  First, what is a "Nukee" anyway?  "Nuke E" is short for NUKElear Engineer, of course.  Despite what we learn from road signs, Berkeley is replete with these tortured souls. / Jesus:  You'll find that the life of a Nukee is just like yours or mine -- filled with lessons, loves, libations, and giant robot ants. / Jesus:  Of course, we all remember MY ant, well documented in the First Epistle of Paul to the Libelous Neighbors.  But that's another story!  "Toon" in Friday to Meet the Nukees Cast!

Jesus:  Ahem!  First an apology.  It seems I may have upset my most valued readers when I introduced myself to Cal students yesterday as Jesus Christ, Devourer of Souls ... / [[SIGN:  TODAY: Meet the Cast!]] / Jesus:  That's right, we mistakenly displayed the highly trademarked "Cal" logo without the requisite wheelbarrow of cash and semi-precious gems to back it up. / Jesus:  Of course, we would never dream of upsetting the UC Regents!  Or any other hypersensitive political group!  Now on to meeeting the cast! / First, meet GAV, mad scientist about town, in his Canadian bacon yarmulke and bunny pelt lab coat, hand crafted by skilled child slave labor artisans from South Africa. / Gav: (There's no "Y" in "Gav," baby...)

Jesus:  Looks like we're running a little short on time, so there will be no time for offensive or controversial jokes today.  Let's move on and meet some more Nukees cast members! / Danny:  How much phlegm would Errol Flynn fling if Errol Flynn could fling phlegm? / Jesus:  Meet Danny, your average plasma physicist next door.  Hell, I'm omniscient and even I don't understand what he says most of the time. / Jesus:  Then there's King Luca, Suzy Gee, Jeannie, the Egyptian goddess of truth and order Ma'at, Steve, Dr. Goldfinger, Cecilia, Linus, Teri the homicidal A.I., Barbie, and a giant electric zombie squid ... / Jesus:  Okay, great!  We have some time left over!  So who knows why women fake orgasms?  Beause they think we care!  Ha!  So toon in Monday when we'll -- / Suzy Gee:  You ain't making it to Monday, joke boy.

I'll be supplying the 411 on Nukees for the rest of the week. / Ma'at:  Unfortunately, our hippie-geek friend left me only three days to cover four and a half years!  Not quite sporting if you ask me.

Nukees - Friday, October 19, 2001
Ma'at:  Okay, this is my last day, so let's wrap up this madcap recap! Ever since the A.I. Teri got loose, she has been trying to kill Gav every few months, usually in the form of a killer robot.  Yeah, AGAIN with the robots! / Ma'at:  [[Voiceover]] Let's see ... I guess there was a bunch of other stuff, like King Luca inventing the "Agnostica" holiday, Danny getting thrown into an asylum, and Gav dying and meeting me in the afterlife.  Go read it all at nukees.com. / Ma'at:  In other words, none of these "Nukees" has seen the inside of a classroom in years, thus refuting the rumor that the strip has nothing to do with Berkeley or college life anymore.  And now you're all caught up!  More or less ... / Teri:  You forgot to describe the CURRENT plotline. / Ma'at:  And in TRUE Berkeley style, time for me to go beg and plead for an extension.

Their regular output is translated into confidence-weighted "fighting" modules which compete in higher thought-process "battlefields" on your servers. / Teri:  This competition guides my consciousness.

No, not a DATE!! / Suzy Gee: *sigh*  Because I have no girlfriends... because I have no car... because I have no LIFE, look, do you want to go or not? / [[Suzy Gee begins walking to her front door, still on the phone.]] / Suzy Gee: I don't see what ROBOTS have to do with... fine, I'll buy you a Guinness... / [[Suzy has opened the door]] / Suzy Gee: Honestly, I half expected to see you instantly appear at my door after that... / [[Gav is climbing in through a window, behind her]] / Gav: Your callbox is >erk< broken.

[[Suzy Gee helps Gav climb into her apartment through a window.]] / Suzy Gee: Dear lord, Gav. You know I live on the third floor?! / Gav: Not at first. We should go-- Your downstairs neighbor is calling the police. / Suzy Gee: Not just yet. I have to change. I look fat in everything. / Gav: If you look fat in everything, what are you going to change into? / Suzy Gee: Whatever I don't look fat in... / Gav: But you just said... / Suzy Gee: How about these shoes? I think they make my arms look fat... / Gav: You could change into a man. We're never fat.

[[While waiting for Suzy to get ready, Gav glances at a book whose title seems to be "Men are from Earth".]] / Suzy Gee: Okay, now I want to show you the pink top. You've seen it before, but that was fifteen pounds ago. / Gav: What is wrong with you, Gee? You're being such a Cathy! / Suzy Gee: Hel-LO! Monster hips... Two protruding fat sacs... Colored crap all over my face! I AM a GIRL, you know! / Gav: Prove it. Take off all your clothes. / Suzy Gee: Good idea. Be right back. / Gav: Point being, you're a scientist, too. You should be above all this illogical girl stuff. / Suzy Gee: Now tell me, am I stupid for buying this outfit, or do I just really look this hideous!? / Gav: Danger! Logic circuits failing!

Suzy Gee: Now these shoes or the ones before? / Gav: This is another trick, isn't it? These are the same shoes. / Suzy: No, the other shoes give me blisters here, here, and here. These just make me bleed here and back here. / Gav: Why don't you just buy shoes that fit? / [[Suzy Gee is wracked with silent laughter.]] / Gav: What? Well they should at least give you a free box of band-aids with each shoe!!

[[Gav examines Suzy Gee's shoe.]] / Gav: Why would you wear this torture device? Its only function is to concentrate all your body weight into squeezing your toes into a singularity. / [[He sketches out an engineering diagram of the shoe.]] / Gav: Actually, it's an impressive bit of engineering. You'd be hard pressed as your pinky toe to design a more efficient foot crusher without an external power source. / Suzy: Yes yes... Woman's [sic] shoes are stupid. Funny, ha. / Gav: No, seriously! I challenge you to cause a greater pain using only your own body weight. / [[A shoe smacks Gav in the face.]] / Gav: Ah, but see, I was right! You had to use the shoe!

Suzy Gee: Now what about this outfit? / Gav: You've already WORN this!! / Suzy Gee: Well... yes. But what do you think of it now? / Gav: I can't take this anymore! I have no interest in what you wear... Just pick anything! / Suzy Gee: Ugh. I look fat in anything. How can I leave the house looking like this? / Gav: Suzy Gee, get a grip! You're HOT! You've always been hot! Why else would I keep hitting on you? / Suzy Gee: Big whoop. I've seen you flirt with foliage... / Gav: Who knew Jello shots could be made with ethanol?

Gav: Okay! Time to go!! / Suzy Gee: Oh, settle! What else were you going to do tonight? Work on your thesis? / Gav: Hey, it took me a long time to remember my research topic! / Suzy: Face it, Gav. You're NEVER getting your Ph.D. / Gav: That's not true! One day it'll happen... I see it clearly! Everyone will be there: Robodanny, Luca-in-exile, our illegitimate children, my girl: Egyptian goddess of truth, Dr. Linus... What a grand fine day it will be to file documents! / [[We see into Gav's imagination, where future Gav is indeed trying to file a half-meter stack of documents. He's asking the clerk, "What do you mean, 'wrong kind of paper'?"]] / Suzy: What, no ceremo-- Wait...

Suzy Gee: Okay, I'm ready. / Gav: Nerf! That's the outfit you were wearing when I got here! / Gav: Never mind. Let's just go while we... still... / Suzy Gee: What? / Gav: It's past midnight. By the time we drive across the bridge and circle around the city looking for parking... it'll be last call! We completely missed Saturday night. / Suzy: Well, next Saturday then. Meet me back here next week at nine. / Gav: Are you sure thirteen hours will be enough time?!

[[Gav is thinking about Suzy Gee.]] / Gav: You know, Gav baby, you're quickly running out of allies in the nukee department. It wouldn't hurt to muster some sympathy. She has been through a rough time. / Gav: Plus she's looking for a sweet "rebound" guy. It's still evil if being nice serves nefarious purposes. / [[Gav speaks aloud.]] / Hey Suzy Gee, I just wanted to-- YOWZA!! / Suzy: EEE!! / Gav: 'Course, who knew how FAR I would rebound?

Suzy Gee: Okay, all right! So you saw half a boob for a quarter second! Big whoop! / Gav: You don't understand men any better than I understand you, do I? / Gav: It doesn't matter how long you're naked -- we can store it indefinitely for future use. As for how much, there's the mental mosaic reconstruction combining fleshy parts of seven different outfits, duplication and mirroring of symmetric body parts, filling in gaps with bits from Victoria's Secret catalogs... / Suzy: And yet you can't remember a single one of those actual outfits, can you?! / Gav: Who cares? My collection is finally complete!

[[Gav confides in the barmaid, Jeannie.]] / Gav: And then by the time she was ready, it was too late to go out. Infuriating! / Jeannie: Sounds like someone's in LUU-UVE! / Gav: Huh? / Jeannie: Oh nothing. I've been saying that to everyone lately just to see how they react. / Gav: Does it work? / Jeannie: Sorta. The more defensive you get, the higher the level of "LUU-UVE!" / Gav: Ooo! I wanna play! Pretend I just said "Pfshaw!" / Jeannie: That's what that guy over there said! He's in "Liiike-like!"

Gav: Now, what if I'd been all, like, "WhatEVER!" / Jeannie: Ooo, that would indicate you "fancy" her. / Gav: And if I'd been all, "As IF!" / Jeannie: Was a vex cast on you, baby, 'cuz you seem "bewitched!" / Gav: "C'ha?" / Jeannie: Um, "Fondly amative infatuation leading, inevitably, to ardent uxoriousness." / Gav: Word-of-the-day calendar? / Jeannie: Someone left a pocket thesaurus here last night.

Gav: Danny, this department needs more giant robots. / Danny: Er! You have said that this week already. / Gav: Really? Then where are the robots? / Danny: Simply complaining loudly does not effect a solution. Why do you not solve the problem yourself? / Gav: That's what I've been doing. I noted verbally the robot shortage. Next, someone hears me and corrects the problem. Q.E.D. / Danny: You know, some students take actual classes in robotics at this university. / Gav: ...who are just waiting for a class project! Brilliance!

Come on in, I'm almost ready. / Gav: By "almost," you mean... / Suzy Gee: I've narrowed it down to the pink top or the black V-neck. / Gav: It's okay. I brought a book this time. / Suzy Gee: I know you know this isn't a date. But thank you anyway for the flowers. / Gav: S'nuthin'. Those things grow everywhere outside the toxicology lab. / Suzy Gee: Do you give a fistful of poison to all your dates? / Gav: Some bring their own!

Suzy Gee: I hope you don't mind if I don't trust you... / Gav: I'd think less of you if you did. / Suzy Gee: but I'm pinning one of these toxic flowers on you. / Suzy Gee: If you drop dead by the end of the evening, I'm throwing the flowers away. / Gav: What if I'm hit by a bus? / Suzy Gee: Yes, even then. One can never be too safe. / Gav: I disagree! One can never be too paranoid! / Gav: Safety is just administrative rules for those not paranoid enough! / Suzy Gee: Does this explain the permanently sealed room in our lab's basement?

Suzy Gee: Just had to freshen my makeup a bit... / Gav: Freshen?! But you just put it on five minutes ago... Ah nevermind. Let's just go before your hairspray evaporates or something... / Suzy: Oh yeah, my hair... / Gav: NNG! / Suzy: So this is your car? / Gav: Yeah--Don't make fun of her, Sabrina's sensitive. / Suzy: I'm sensitive!

[[Traffic moving along the Bay Bridge]] / Suzy Gee: You know Gav, "Sabrina" seems an awfully conventional name for your car. / Gav: She didn't go for "Gavmotron 7000" okay? / [[From inside Gav's car. Gav is facing forward.  Suzy is looking over at him.]] / Gav: Look, you can manipulate the lives around you as much as you want, but some things just end up naming themselves. / Suzy Gee: Like YOU?  / [[Gav's car from the outside]] / Gav: What do you mean? / Suzy Gee: Well "Gav" isn't REALLY a name, is it? I always figured it was short for "Gavin," but that's not what it says on your transcripts. / [[From the back seat of Gav's car.  Gav is now looking over at Suzy.]] / Gav: Yes, well... Hey what are you doing with MY transcripts?! / Suzy Gee: I know a big, tough, evil "mad scientist" in this car who failed a POETRY CLASS junior year!!

Nukees - Monday, June 23, 2003
Gav: The instructor and I had creative differences and I stopped attending class, but after the drop deadline... Apparently back then, my life was lacking in sufficient hardships to write poetry. / Suzy Gee: Lacking in hardships? Didn't he see your real name on the class roster? / Gav: Ha ha. Very funny. I don't have to drive you HOME, you know. / Suzy Gee: I just want to know how you end up with a name like that... / Gav: It was a long, difficult labor. Mom must've seen a bottle on a supply cart on the way to the delivery room and, through drugs and homones, convinced herself it was a REAL name. Dad just preferred to avoid arguements. [sic] / Suzy Gee: You were a difficult labor?! No! / Gav: Keep it up, Ms. Gee. I feel a poem coming on: "There once was a blonde forced to hitch..."

I'll circle the block... / Suzy Gee: No trick! Park there! Park now! / Gav: A spot this convenient goes against everything I know to be true about parking in the city. / Suzy Gee: So we got lucky! Maybe the parking spirits are rewarding me for not owning a car?! / Gav: So you're saying your parking karma just ran over my parking dogma? / Suzy Gee: I almost certainly am not.

You're strictly "Tier 2" / Cecilia: What? / Gav: The more players, the better, but to play seven-card games with a 52-card deck, we cant have more than seven players. Your presence makes eight. / Gav: Only those friends we can trust to show up are initially invited. They represent the top tier. We invite you "Tier Twos" only if a "Tier One" can't make it. / Cecilia: So...what? I don't get it. Are you running some kind of pyramid scheme? / Gav: Several, but that's unrelated.

Starting from the axiom that supreme beings are omnipresent, via the uncertainty principle, his or her momentum, and thus temperature, approaches zero. / Christine: But only in an infinite universe, assuming the Lord has mass. / Danny: True. / Gav: Oh my god, please tell me you're not here to talk about PHYSICS? / Rita: Oh no. / Rita: We're here to talk about the Lord Jesus Christ! / Gav: [[recoiling like a vampire seeing a cross]] AH!

But just a sec. Is it just me or do you girls NOT seem... "Devout"? I mean, look at all this cleavage. / Danny: [[apparently complying with Gav's suggestion]] Okay. / Jezebel: Jesus loves cleavage. / Gav: Well AMEN to THAT.

Gav: How can you be Christians? You all dress like witches. / Jezebel: So do nuns. / [[Jezebel lights a cigarette]] / Gav: But you're drinking... Smoking! / Jezebel: Jesus turned water to wine. THAT's a boy who knows how to PARTY! / Jezebel: And I challenge you to find "Thou shalt not suck on a cancerstick" in the Book. / Gav: What about "Thy body is a temple?" / Jezebel: [[blowing smoke in Gav's face]] INCENSE, then. / Gav: I kinda like YOU.

Rita: So tell me, Gav, are you often confused by moral decisions? / Gav: Of others, yes. Whare's Danny? / Rita: He departed with Juila [sic] and Christine. / Gav: Oh no you don't.

We'll get there before him. / Sign reads: Stairs ----> / Rita: Funny, I've got five bars, but wherever Julia's gone, she's got no signal. They shouldn't have left the building. / Rita: I'd say there's either some wacky science experiment interfering, or they're in the basement. / Jezebel: Can't it be both? Maybe they've got a nuclear reactor in the basement. / Rita: Don't be a smart ass, Jez.

Danny: Now the postulate of a supreme being involves many variables. We must hypothesize separately the existence of either an "active" or a "passive" god. / Danny: We can subdivide the definition of "active" into "able or not able to circumvent his or her own laws," and yet further consider beings responsible, respectively, for all, some, or none of the laws of physics. / [[Christine raises her hand]] / Danny: Yes? / Christine: What are you writing on the white board? / Danny: I am unsure. It is what I am used to doing.
http://nukees.com/d/20050124.html
Nukees - Wednesday, January 26, 2005
Danny: Now, testing an "active" god of the first kind is nigh trivial. We simply look for local violations of the laws of physics. / [[Julia raises her hand]] / Danny: Another question? / Julia: Christianity is based on FAITH. You cannot TEST the Lord's existence. We BELIEVE because we KNOW it to be true in our hearts. / [[Danny turns back to the white board, ignoring the remark.]] / Danny: Now, an "active" god of the second kind may be demonstrated by local closed system decreases in entropy.

Your Jesus voodoo won't wash on me! / Jezebel: I'm just sayin'... Do you LIKE feeling angry all the time? Wouldn't you rather feel LOVE all the time? / Gav: ALL the time? I dunno. How about 15 minutes in the supply closet? / Jezebel: Classy! Feel your own love man-harlot.

Jezebel: Now, you want to know what I find sexy? / Gav: I'm guessing stigmata. But keep it to yourself. I am immune to your persuasion. / Gav: Despite your . . . uh . . . overabundance, you must be chaste. Sans sex, you're nothing to me. / Gav: That curse you call "love" is an evolutionary throwback, doomed only to pain in modern society, like the appendix or armpit hair! / Jezebel: [[holding her left breast]] Yeah . . . something like THAT! / Rita: Jezebel!
